<div class="transnote">
<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>This book was published in 1905; only 440 copies were printed.</p>

<p>The first chapter, <a href="#Page_1">Verrazano’s voyage</a> in 1524, is a modern translation of the
original Italian. The other chapters are literal reproductions of
their original English publications, and so retain the spelling, the
hyphenation and punctuation seen in those books.</p>

<p>This etext maintains this careful reproduction of the original English text.
Variant spellings of names and place names have not been changed.</p>

<p>A double space, in the narrative of the <a href="#Page_153">Popham voyage</a> (pp. 155-175),
is denoted by ·· and indicates, in most cases, the start of a new
sentence.</p>

<p>Multiple spaces in a paragraph are denoted by ······· and indicate
a blank space in the original text for a missing name or date.</p>

<p class="customcover">The cover image was created by the transcriber
and is placed in the public domain.</p>

<p>Three minor changes have been made to the etext:<br />
<a href="#tn-27">Page 27</a>: ‘Com of _Essex_’ has a ~ (tilde) over the m in the original text.<br />
<a href="#tn-123">Page 123</a>: ‘assoone as they’ replaced by ‘as soone as they’.<br />
<a href="#tn-155">Page 155</a> Sidenote: ‘<i>1605 June</i>’ replaced by ‘<i>1607 June</i>’.<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Giovanni da Verrazano</span>, <em>a Florentine sailor in the
service of France who had attracted the royal attention
by his successful attacks on Spanish commerce, was commissioned
by Francis I, in the spring of 1523, to cross
the Atlantic in search for a sea route to Cathay. In
April, the agents of Spain in France notified their government
that Verrazano was ready to start. Two months
later, the Spanish authorities learned that he had returned
to La Rochelle, bringing the captured vessels in
which Cortes had shipped the treasure gathered from the
Aztec lords of Mexico. The proposed voyage of discovery
was not, however, merely a blind for this attack on the
Spanish West Indian fleet. Verrazano refitted his ships
and made a second start, only to be driven back by a Biscayan
storm. With his single remaining seaworthy vessel,
he finally got away for the West. In March, 1524,
land was sighted, probably near Cape Fear, on the Carolina
coast. After looking in vain for a harbour toward
the south, he turned northward and followed the shore
line as far as Maine or Nova Scotia.</em></p>

<p><em>Verrazano arrived in Dieppe before the eighth of
July, the date of his report to the King. An Italian
version of this letter was printed at Venice in 1556 by
Ramusio, from whose “Navigationi” it was translated
into English by Hakluyt, for his “Divers Voyages,”
printed in 1582. A somewhat different contemporary
manuscript copy, also in Italian, is preserved at Florence.
This was printed by the New York Historical Society in
1841, with a translation which has been revised for the
present volume.</em></p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SINCE the tempests which we encountered
on the northern coasts, I have not
written to your most Serene and Christian
Majesty concerning the four ships sent out
by your orders on the ocean to discover new
lands, because I thought you must have been
before apprized of all that had happened to us&mdash;that
we had been compelled by the impetuous
violence of the winds to put into Brittany in
distress with only the two ships Normandy and
Dauphine; and that after having repaired these
ships, we made a cruise in them, well armed,
along the coast of Spain, as your Majesty must
have heard, and also of our new plan of continuing
our intended voyage with the Dauphine
alone; being now returned from this voyage, I
proceed to give your Majesty an account of our
discoveries.</p>

<p>On the 17th of last January we set sail from
a desolate rock near the island of Madeira, <span class="sidenote"><i>January 1524</i></span> belonging
to his most Serene Majesty, the King of
Portugal, with fifty men, having provisions sufficient
for eight months, arms and other warlike<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
munition and naval stores. Sailing westward
with a light and pleasant easterly breeze, in
twenty-five days we ran eight hundred leagues.
On the 14th of February we encountered as
violent a hurricane as any ship ever weathered,
from which we escaped unhurt by the divine
assistance and goodness, to the praise of the glorious
and fortunate name of our good ship, that
had been able to support the violent tossing
of the waves. Pursuing our voyage towards the
West, a little northwardly, in twenty-four days
more, <span class="sidenote"><i>March</i></span>having run four hundred leagues, we
reached a new country, which had never before
been seen by any one, either in ancient or modern
times. At first it appeared to be very low,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Carolina Coast</i></span>but on approaching it to within a quarter of
a league from the shore we perceived, by the
great fires near the coast, that it was inhabited.
We perceived that it stretched to the south, and
coasted along in that direction in search of
some port, in which we might come to anchor,
and examine into the nature of the country,
but for fifty leagues we could find none in
which we could lie securely. Seeing the coast
still stretch to the south, we resolved to change
our course and stand to the northward, and as
we still had the same difficulty, we drew in
with the land and sent a boat on shore. Many
people who were seen coming to the sea-side
fled at our approach, but occasionally stopping,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
they looked back upon us with astonishment,
and some were at length induced, by various
friendly signs, to come to us. These showed
the greatest delight on beholding us, wondering
at our dress, countenances and complexion.
They then showed us by signs where we could
more conveniently secure our boat, and offered
us some of their provisions. That your Majesty
may know all that we learned, while on shore,
of their manners and customs of life, I will relate
what we saw as briefly as possible. They
go entirely naked, except that about the loins
they wear skins of small animals like martens
fastened by a girdle of plaited grass, to which
they tie, all round the body, the tails of other
animals hanging down to the knees; all other
parts of the body and the head are naked. Some
wear garlands similar to birds’ feathers.</p>

<p>The complexion of these people is black, not
much different from that of the Ethiopians;
their hair is black and thick, and not very long,
it is worn tied back upon the head in the form
of a little tail. In person they are of good proportions,
of middle stature, a little above our
own, broad across the breast, strong in the
arms, and well formed in the legs and other
parts of the body; the only exception to their
good looks is that they have broad faces, but
not all, however, as we saw many that had
sharp ones, with large black eyes and a fixed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
expression. They are not very strong in body,
but acute in mind, active and swift of foot, as
far as we could judge by observation. In these
last two particulars they resemble the people
of the east, especially those the most remote.
We could not learn a great many particulars of
their usages on account of our short stay among
them, and the distance of our ship from the
shore.</p>

<p>We found not far from this people another
whose mode of life we judged to be similar.
The whole shore is covered with fine sand,
about fifteen feet thick, rising in the form of
little hills about fifty paces broad. Ascending
farther, we found several arms of the sea which
make in through inlets, washing the shores on
both sides as the coast runs. An outstretched
country appears at a little distance <span class="sidenote"><i>The Carolinas</i></span>rising somewhat
above the sandy shore in beautiful fields
and broad plains, covered with immense forests
of trees, more or less dense, too various in colours,
and too delightful and charming in appearance
to be described. I do not believe that
they are like the Hercynian forest or the rough
wilds of Scythia, and the northern regions full
of vines and common trees, but adorned with
palms, laurels, cypresses, and other varieties unknown
in Europe, that send forth the sweetest
fragrance to a great distance, but which we
could not examine more closely for the reasons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
before given, and not on account of any difficulty
in traversing the woods, which, on the
contrary, are easily penetrated.</p>

<p>As the Orient stretches around this country,
I think it cannot be devoid of the same medicinal
and aromatic drugs, and various riches of
gold and the like, as is denoted by the colour
of the ground. It abounds also in animals, as
deer, stags, hares, and many other similar, and
with a great variety of birds for every kind of
pleasant and delightful sport. It is plentifully
supplied with lakes and ponds of running water,
and being in the latitude of 34, the air is salubrious,
pure and temperate, and free from the
extremes of both heat and cold. There are no
violent winds in these regions, the most prevalent
are the north-west and west. In summer,
the season in which we were there, the sky is
clear, with but little rain: if fogs and mists
are at any time driven in by the south wind,
they are immediately dissipated, and at once
it becomes serene and bright again. The sea is
calm, not boisterous, and its waves are gentle.
Although the whole coast is low and without
harbours, it is not dangerous for navigation,
being free from rocks and bold, so that within
four or five fathoms from the shore there is
twenty-four feet of water at all times of tide,
and this depth constantly increases in a uniform
proportion. The holding ground is so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
good that no ship can part her cable, however
violent the wind, as we proved by experience;
for while riding at anchor on the coast, we
were overtaken by a gale in the beginning of
March, when the winds are high, as is usual in
all countries, we found our anchor broken before
it started from its hold or moved at all.</p>

<p>We set sail from this place, continuing to
coast along the shore, which we found stretching
out to the west; <span class="sidenote"><i>North Carolina</i></span>the inhabitants being
numerous, we saw everywhere a multitude of
fires. While at anchor on this coast, there
being no harbour to enter, we sent the boat on
shore with twenty-five men to obtain water,
but it was not possible to land without endangering
the boat, on account of the immense
high surf thrown up by the sea, as it was an
open roadstead. Many of the natives came to
the beach, indicating by various friendly signs
that we might trust ourselves on shore. One
of their noble deeds of friendship deserves to
be made known to your Majesty. A young
sailor was attempting to swim ashore through
the surf to carry them some knick-knacks, as
little bells, looking-glasses, and other like trifles;
when he came near three or four of them he
tossed the things to them, and turned about to
get back to the boat, but he was thrown over
by the waves, and so dashed by them that he
lay as it were dead upon the beach. When these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
people saw him in this situation, they ran and
took him up by the head, legs and arms, and
carried him to a distance from the surf; the
young man, finding himself borne off in this
way, uttered very loud shrieks in fear and dismay,
while they answered as they could in
their language, showing him that he had no
cause for fear. Afterwards they laid him down
at the foot of a little hill, when they took off
his shirt and trowsers, and examined him,
expressing the greatest astonishment at the
whiteness of his skin. Our sailors in the boat
seeing a great fire made up, and their companion
placed very near it, full of fear, as is usual
in all cases of novelty, imagined that the natives
were about to roast him for food. But as soon
as he had recovered his strength after a short
stay with them, showing by signs that he wished
to return aboard, they hugged him with great
affection, and accompanied him to the shore,
then leaving him, that he might feel more secure,
they withdrew to a little hill, from which
they watched him until he was safe in the boat.
This young man remarked that these people
were black like the others, that they had shining
skins, middle stature, and sharper faces,
and very delicate bodies and limbs, and that
they were inferior in strength, but quick in
their minds; this is all that he observed of
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>Departing hence, and always following the
shore, which stretched to the north, we came,
in the space of fifty leagues, to another land,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Delaware and New Jersey Coast</i></span> which appeared very beautiful and full of the
largest forests. We approached it, and going
ashore with twenty men, we went back from
the coast about two leagues, and found that the
people had fled and hid themselves in the woods
for fear. By searching around we discovered in
the grass a very old woman and a young girl of
about eighteen or twenty, who had concealed
themselves for the same reason; the old woman
carried two infants on her shoulders, and behind
her neck a little boy eight years of age;
when we came up to them they began to shriek
and make signs to the men who had fled to the
woods. We gave them a part of our provisions,
which they accepted with delight, but the girl
would not touch any; every thing we offered to
her being thrown down in great anger. We
took the little boy from the old woman to carry
with us to France, and would have taken the
girl also, who was very beautiful and very tall,
but it was impossible because of the loud shrieks
she uttered as we attempted to lead her away;
having to pass some woods, and being far from
the ship, we determined to leave her and take
the boy only. We found them fairer than the
others, and wearing a covering made of certain
plants, which hung down from the branches of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the trees, tying them together with threads of
wild hemp; their heads are without covering
and of the same shape as the others. Their
food is a kind of pulse which there abounds,
different in colour and size from ours, and of a
very delicious flavour. Besides they take birds
and fish for food, using snares and bows made of
hard wood, with reeds for arrows, in the ends
of which they put the bones of fish and other
animals. The animals in these regions are wilder
than in Europe from being continually molested
by the hunters. We saw many of their boats
made of one tree twenty feet long and four feet
broad, without the aid of stone or iron or other
kind of metal. In the whole country for the
space of two hundred leagues, which we visited,
we saw no stone of any sort. To hollow out
their boats they burn out as much of a log as is
requisite, and also from the prow and stern to
make them float well on the sea. The land, in
situation, fertility and beauty, is like the other,
abounding also in forests filled with various
kinds of trees, but not of such fragrance, as it
is more northern and colder.</p>

<p>We saw in this country many vines growing
naturally, which entwine about the trees, and
run up upon them as they do in the plains of
Lombardy. These vines would doubtless produce
excellent wine if they were properly cultivated
and attended to, as we have often seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
the grapes which they produce very sweet and
pleasant, and not unlike our own. They must
be held in estimation by them, as they carefully
remove the shrubbery from around them,
wherever they grow, to allow the fruit to ripen
better. We found also wild roses, violets, lilies,
and many sorts of plants and fragrant flowers
different from our own. We cannot describe
their habitations, as they are in the interior of
the country, but from various indications we
conclude they must be formed of trees and
shrubs. We saw also many grounds for conjecturing
that they often sleep in the open air,
without any covering but the sky. Of their
other usages we know nothing; we believe,
however, that all the people we were among
live in the same way.</p>

<p>After having remained here three days, riding
at anchor on the coast, as we could find
no harbour we determined to depart, and coast
along the shore to the north-east, keeping sail
on the vessel only by day, and coming to anchor
by night. After proceeding one hundred
leagues, we found a very pleasant situation
among some steep hills, through which a very
large river, deep at its mouth, forced its way
to the sea; <span class="sidenote"><i>New York Harbour</i></span>from the sea to the estuary of the
river, any ship heavily laden might pass, with
the help of the tide, which rises eight feet.
But as we were riding at anchor in a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
berth, we would not venture up in our vessel,
without a knowledge of the mouth; therefore
we took the boat, and entering the river, we
found the country on its banks well peopled,
the inhabitants not differing much from the
others, being dressed out with the feathers of
birds of various colours. They came towards
us with evident delight, raising loud shouts of
admiration, and showing us where we could
most securely land with our boat. We passed
up this river, about half a league, when we
found it formed a most beautiful lake three
leagues in circuit, upon which they were rowing
thirty or more of their small boats, from
one shore to the other, filled with multitudes
who came to see us. All of a sudden, as is
wont to happen to navigators, a violent contrary
wind blew in from the sea, and forced us to
return to our ship, greatly regretting to leave
this region which seemed so commodious and
delightful, and which we supposed must also
contain great riches, as the hills showed many
indications of minerals. Weighing anchor, we
sailed fifty leagues toward the east, as the coast
stretched in that direction, and always in sight
of it; <span class="sidenote"><i>Block Island</i></span>at length we discovered an island of a triangular
form, about ten leagues from the mainland,
in size about equal to the island of Rhodes,
having many hills covered with trees, and well
peopled, judging from the great number of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
fires which we saw all around its shores; we
gave it the name of your Majesty’s illustrious
mother.</p>

<p>We did not land there, as the weather was
unfavourable, but proceeded to another place,
fifteen leagues distant from the island, where
we found a very excellent harbour. <span class="sidenote"><i>Newport Harbour</i></span>Before entering
it, we saw about twenty small boats full
of people, who came about our ship, uttering
many cries of astonishment, but they would not
approach nearer than within fifty paces; stopping,
they looked at the structure of our ship,
our persons and dress, afterwards they all raised
a loud shout together, signifying that they were
pleased. By imitating their signs, we inspired
them in some measure with confidence, so that
they came near enough for us to toss to them
some little bells and glasses, and many toys,
which they took and looked at, laughing, and
then came on board without fear. Among them
were two kings more beautiful in form and
stature than can possibly be described; one was
about forty years old, the other about twenty-four,
and they were dressed in the following
manner: The oldest had a deer’s skin around
his body, artificially wrought in damask figures,
his head was without covering, his hair was tied
back in various knots; around his neck he wore
a large chain ornamented with many stones of
different colours. The young man was similar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
in his general appearance. This is the finest
looking tribe, and the handsomest in their costumes,
that we have found in our voyage. They
exceed us in size, and they are of a very fair complexion;
some of them incline more to a white,
and others to a tawny colour; their faces are
sharp, their hair long and black, upon the adorning
of which they bestow great pains; their eyes
are black and sharp, their expression mild and
pleasant, greatly resembling the antique. I say
nothing to your Majesty of the other parts of
the body, which are all in good proportion,
and such as belong to well-formed men. Their
women are of the same form and beauty, very
graceful, of fine countenances and pleasing appearance
in manners and modesty; they wear
no clothing except a deer skin, ornamented like
those worn by the men; some wear very rich
lynx skins upon their arms, and various ornaments
upon their heads, composed of braids of
hair, which also hang down upon their breasts
on each side. Others wear different ornaments,
such as the women of Egypt and Syria use. The
older and the married people, both men and
women, wear many ornaments in their ears,
hanging down in the oriental manner. We saw
upon them several pieces of wrought copper,
which is more esteemed by them than gold, as
this is not valued on account of its colour, but
is considered by them as the most ordinary of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the metals&mdash;yellow being the colour especially
disliked by them; azure and red are those in
highest estimation with them. Of those things
which we gave them, they prized most highly
the bells, azure crystals, and other toys to hang
in their ears and about their necks; they do not
value or care to have silk or gold stuffs, or other
kinds of cloth, nor implements of steel or iron.
When we showed them our arms, they expressed
no admiration, and only asked how they were
made; the same was the case with the looking-glasses,
which they returned to us, smiling, as
soon as they had looked at them. They are
very generous, giving away whatever they have.
We formed a great friendship with them, and
one day we entered into the port with our ship,
having before rode at the distance of a league
from the shore, as the weather was adverse.
They came off to the ship with a number of
their little boats, with their faces painted in
divers colours, showing us real signs of joy,
bringing us of their provisions, and signifying
to us where we could best ride in safety with
our ship, and keeping with us until we had
cast anchor. We remained among them fifteen
days, to provide ourselves with many things of
which we were in want, during which time
they came every day to see our ship, bringing
with them their wives, of whom they were
very careful; for, although they came on board<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
themselves, and remained a long while, they
made their wives stay in the boats, nor could
we ever get them on board by any entreaties
or any presents we could make them. One of
the two kings often came with his queen and
many attendants, to see us for his amusement;
but he always stopped at the distance of about
two hundred paces, and sent a boat to inform us
of his intended visit, saying they would come
and see our ship&mdash;this was done for safety, and
as soon as they had an answer from us they came
off, and remained awhile to look around; but
on hearing the annoying cries of the sailors, the
king sent the queen, with her attendants, in a
very light boat, to wait, near an island a quarter
of a league distant from us, while he remained
a long time on board, talking with us by signs,
and expressing his fanciful notions about every
thing in the ship, and asking the use of all.
After imitating our modes of salutation, and
tasting our food, he courteously took leave of
us. Sometimes, when our men stayed two or
three days on a small island, near the ship, for
their various necessities, as sailors are wont to
do, he came with seven or eight of his attendants,
to inquire about our movements, often
asking us if we intended to remain there long,
and offering us everything at his command, and
then he would shoot with his bow, and run up
and down with his people, making great sport<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
for us. We often went five or six leagues into
the interior, and found the country as pleasant
as is possible to conceive, adapted to cultivation
of every kind, whether of corn, wine or
oil; there are open plains twenty-five or thirty
leagues in extent, entirely free from trees or
other hindrances, and of so great fertility, that
whatever is sown there will yield an excellent
crop. On entering the woods, we observed that
they might all be traversed by an army ever so
numerous; the trees of which they were composed,
were oaks, cypresses, and others unknown
in Europe. We found, also, apples, plumbs, filberts,
and many other fruits, but all of a different
kind from ours. The animals, which are in
great numbers, as stags, deer, lynxes, and many
other species, are taken by snares, and by bows,
the latter being their chief implement; their
arrows are wrought with great beauty, and for
the heads of them, they use emery, jasper, hard
marble, and other sharp stones, in the place of
iron. They also use the same kind of sharp
stones in cutting down trees, and with them
they construct their boats of single logs, hollowed
out with admirable skill, and sufficiently
commodious to contain ten or twelve persons;
their oars are short, and broad at the end, and
are managed in rowing by force of the arms
alone, with perfect security, and as nimbly as
they choose. We saw their dwellings, which are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
of a circular form, of about ten or twelve paces
in circumference, made of logs split in halves,
without any regularity of architecture, and covered
with roofs of straw, nicely put on, which
protect them from wind and rain. There is
no doubt that they could build stately edifices
if they had workmen as skilful as ours, for the
whole sea-coast abounds in shining stones, crystals,
and alabaster, and for the same reason it has
coverts and retreats for animals. They change
their habitations from place to place as circumstances
of situation and season may require; this
is easily done, as they have only to take with
them their mats, and they have other houses prepared
at once. The father and the whole family
dwell together in one house in great numbers;
in some we saw twenty-five or thirty persons.
Their food is pulse, as with the other tribes,
which is here better than elsewhere, and more
carefully cultivated; in the time of sowing
they are governed by the moon, the sprouting
of grain, and many other ancient usages. They
live by hunting and fishing, and they are long-lived.
If they fall sick, they cure themselves
without medicine, by the heat of the fire, and
their death at last comes from extreme old age.
We judge them to be very affectionate and charitable
towards their relatives&mdash;making loud
lamentations in their adversity, and in their
misery calling to mind all their good fortune.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
At their departure out of life, their relations
mutually join in weeping, mingled with singing,
for a long while. This is all that we could
learn of them. This region is situated in the
parallel of Rome, being 41° 40′ of north latitude,
but much colder from accidental circumstances,
and not by nature, as I shall hereafter
explain to your Majesty, and confine myself at
present to the description of its local situation.
It looks towards the south, on which side the
harbour is half a league broad; afterwards, upon
entering it, the extent between the coast and
north is twelve leagues, and then enlarging itself
it forms a very large bay, twenty leagues in
circumference, in which are five small islands,
of great fertility and beauty, covered with large
and lofty trees. <span class="sidenote"><i>Narragansett Bay</i></span>Among these islands any fleet,
however large, might ride safely, without fear
of tempests or other dangers. Turning towards
the south, at the entrance of the harbour, on
both sides, there are very pleasant hills, and
many streams of clear water, which flow down
to the sea. In the midst of the entrance, there
is a rock of freestone, formed by nature, and
suitable for the construction of any kind of
machine or bulwark for the defence of the
harbour.</p>

<p>Having supplied ourselves with every thing
necessary, on the fifth of May we departed
from the port, and sailed one hundred and fifty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
leagues, keeping so close to the coast as never
to lose it from our sight; the nature of the
country appeared much the same as before, but
the mountains were a little higher, and all in
appearance rich in minerals. We did not stop
to land as the weather was very favourable for
pursuing our voyage, and the country presented
no variety. <span class="sidenote"><i>Cape Cod</i></span>The shore stretched to the east,
and fifty leagues beyond more to the north,
where we found a more elevated country, full
of very thick woods of fir trees, cypresses and
the like, indicative of a cold climate. The
people were entirely different from the others
we had seen, whom we had found kind and
gentle, but these were so rude and barbarous
that we were unable by any signs we could
make, to hold communication with them.
They clothe themselves in the skins of bears,
lynxes, seals and other animals. Their food, as
far as we could judge by several visits to their
dwellings, is obtained by hunting and fishing,
and certain fruits, which are a sort of root of
spontaneous growth. They have no pulse, and
we saw no signs of cultivation; the land appears
sterile and unfit for growing of fruit or
grain of any kind. If we wished at any time
to traffick with them, they came to the sea shore
and stood upon the rocks, from which they
lowered down by a cord to our boats beneath
whatever they had to barter, continually crying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
out to us, not to come nearer, and instantly
demanding from us that which was to be given
in exchange; they took from us only knives,
fish hooks and sharpened steel. No regard was
paid to our courtesies; when we had nothing
left to exchange with them, the men at our
departure made the most brutal signs of disdain
and contempt possible. Against their will we
penetrated two or three leagues into the interior
with twenty-five men; when we came to
the shore, they shot at us with their arrows,
raising the most horrible cries and afterwards
fleeing to the woods. In this region we found
nothing extraordinary except vast forests and
some metalliferous hills, as we infer from seeing
that many of the people wore copper earrings.
Departing from thence, we kept along
the coast, steering north-east, and found the
country more pleasant and open, free from
woods, and distant in the interior we saw
lofty mountains, but none which extended to
the shore. Within fifty leagues we discovered
thirty-two islands, <span class="sidenote"><i>Coast of Maine</i></span>all near the main land, small
and of pleasant appearance, but high and so
disposed as to afford excellent harbours and
channels, as we see in the Adriatic gulph, near
Illyria and Dalmatia. We had no intercourse
with the people, but we judge that they were
similar in nature and usages to those we were
last among. After sailing between east and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
north the distance of one hundred and fifty
leagues more, and finding our provisions and
naval stores nearly exhausted, we took in wood
and water and determined to return to France,
having discovered 502, that is 700 leagues of
unknown lands.</p>

<p>As to the religious faith of all these tribes,
not understanding their language, we could not
discover either by sign or gestures any thing
certain. It seemed to us that they had no religion
nor laws, nor any knowledge of a First
Cause or Mover, that they worshipped neither
the heavens, stars, sun, moon nor other planets;
nor could we learn if they were given to any
kind of idolatry, or offered any sacrifices or
supplications, or if they have temples or houses
of prayer in their villages;&mdash;our conclusion
was, that they have no religious belief whatever,
but live in this respect entirely free. All which
proceeds from ignorance, as they are very easy
to be persuaded, and imitated us with earnestness
and fervour in all which they saw us do as
Christians in our acts of worship.</p>

Dieppe in Normandy, the 8th of July, 1524.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">David Ingram</span> <em>was one of the companions of Sir John
Hawkins, when he was forced to take refuge from a
storm in the Mexican harbour of San Juan de Ulua, in
the autumn of 1568. After several days of amicable traffic
for the slaves brought by Hawkins from Africa, the
English ships were suddenly attacked by an overpowering
Spanish force. Hawkins succeeded in gathering
most of his men into two of the vessels, and in fighting
his way out of the harbour. The escape from danger
was only temporary, however, for the two ships were
so overcrowded that it quickly became evident that they
could not possibly make the voyage across the Atlantic
to England. About a hundred men were therefore set
on shore, on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
Three of these men succeeded in making their way across
the central and eastern portion of what is now the
United States. A French fur-trader found them somewhere
on the eastern Maine coast and carried them back
to Europe.</em></p>

<p><em>One of these trans-continental wanderers, David
Ingram, wrote an account of his adventures, in which he
mingled much fiction with some probable truth. The
paragraphs reprinted here contain the most plausible
portion of his narrative. There are numerous contemporary
manuscript copies of Ingram’s narrative, testifying
to the curiosity which it excited at the time. It was
first printed in 1582 by Hakluyt, who omitted it from
his subsequent publications because of its dubious veracity.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Bartholomew Gosnold</span> <em>and Bartholomew Gilbert,
the latter a son of Sir Humphrey, visited the south-eastern
New England coast in the summer of 1602, for
the purpose of finding out what chances there were for
profitable trading in that region. They probably chose
this locality because it had not before been explored by
English sailors, and because they sailed without a license
from Sir Walter Ralegh, to whom had been granted
the exclusive right of English trade with that part of
the world. Had they succeeded in returning undetected
to England, nobody to-day would know anything about
the details of their voyage. A sudden drop in the price
of sassafras showed Ralegh that something was wrong,
and investigation soon brought their cargo to light. As
some men prominent in the court circle had taken shares
in the Gosnold-Gilbert venture, a compromise was arranged
to avoid public scandal, and Ralegh allowed the
report to go out that he had authorized the voyage. An
account of the voyage, written by John Brereton, was
published for circulation among those who it was hoped
might subscribe toward the cost of equipping another
expedition to the same locality.</em></p>

TO THE HONOURABLE

the Stanneries, Lieutenant
of <em>Cornwall</em>, and Gouernour

</div>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HONOURABLE sir, being earnestly
requested by a deere friend, <span class="sidenote"><i>1602</i></span>to put
downe in writing, some true relation
of our late performed voyage to the North
parts of <em>Virginia</em>; at length I resolued to satisfie
his request, who also imboldened me, to direct
the same to your honourable consideration; to
whom indeed of duetie it perteineth.</p>

<p>May it please your Lordship therefore to
understand, that upon the sixe and twentieth
of March <em>1602</em>, <span class="sidenote"><i>March</i></span>being Friday, we went from
<em>Falmouth</em>, being in all, two &amp; thirtie persons, in
a small barke of <em>Dartmouth</em>, called The <i>Concord</i>,
holding a course for the North part of Virginia:
and although by chance the winde fauoured
vs not at first as we wished, but inforced vs so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
farre to the Southward, as we fell with <em>S. Marie</em>,
one of the islands of the <em>Açores</em> (which was not
much out of our way) yet holding our course
directly from thence, we made our iourney
shorter (than hitherto accustomed) by the better
part of a thousand leagues, yet were wee longer
in our passage than we expected; which happened,
for that our barke being weake, we were
loth to presse her with much saile; also, our
sailers being few, and they none of the best, we
bare (except in faire weather) but low saile; besides,
our going vpon an vnknowen coast, made
vs not ouer-bolde to stand in with the shore, but
in open weather; which caused vs to be certeine
daies in sounding, before we discouered
the coast, the weather being by chance, somewhat
foggie. <span class="sidenote"><i>May</i></span>But on Friday the foureteenth of
May, early in the morning, we made the land,
being full of faire trees, the land somewhat
low, certeine hummocks or hilles lying into the
land, the shore ful of white sand, but very stony
or rocky. And standing faire alongst by the
shore, about twelue of the clocke the same day,
we came to an anker, <span class="sidenote"><i>Cape Neddock Maine</i></span>where sixe Indians, in a
Baske-shallop with mast and saile, an iron grapple,
and a kettle of copper, came boldly aboord
vs, one of them apparelled with a wastcoat and
breeches of blacke serdge, made after our sea-fashion,
hose and shoes on his feet; all the rest
(sauing one that had a paire of breeches of blue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
cloth) were all naked. These people are of tall
stature, broad and grim visage, of a blacke swart
complexion, their eie-browes painted white;
their weapons are bowes and arrowes: it seemed
by some words and signes they made, that some
Basks or of <em>S. Iohn de Luz</em>, haue fished or
traded in this place, being in the latitude of
43 degrees. But riding heere, in no very good
harbour, and withall, doubting the weather,
about three of the clocke the same day in the
afternoone we weighed, &amp; standing Southerly
off into sea the rest of that day and the night
following, with a fresh gale of winde, in the
morning we found ourselues embayed with a
mightie headland; but comming to an anker
about nine of the clocke the same day, within a
league of the shore, <span class="sidenote"><i>Cape Cod</i></span>we hoised out the one halfe
of our shallop, and captaine <em>Bartholomew Gosnold</em>,
my selfe, and three others, went ashore, being a
white sandie and very bolde shore; and marching
all that afternoon with our muskets on our
necks, on the highest hilles which we saw (the
weather very hot) at length we perceiued this
headland to be parcell of the maine, and sundrie
Islands lying almost round about it: so
returning (towards euening) to our shallop (for
by that time, the other part was brought ashore
and set together) we espied an Indian, a yong
man, of proper stature, and of a pleasing countenance;
and after some familiaritie with him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
we left him at the sea side, and returned to our
ship, where, in fiue or sixe houres absence, we
had pestered our ship so with Cod fish, that
we threw numbers of them ouer-boord againe:
and surely, I am persuaded that in the moneths
of March, April, and May, there is vpon this
coast, better fishing, and in as great plentie, as
in <em>Newfoundland</em>: for the sculles of Mackerell,
herrings, Cod, and other fish, that we dayly saw
as we went and came from the shore, were wonderfull;
and besides, the places where we tooke
these Cods (and might in a few daies haue laden
our ship) were but in seuen faddome water, and
within lesse than a league of the shore; where,
in <em>Newfound-land</em> they fish in fortie or fiftie
fadome water, and farre off. From this place,
we sailed round about this headland, almost all
the points of the compasse, the shore very bolde:
but as no coast is free from dangers, so I am
persuaded, this is as free as any; the land somewhat
lowe, full of goodly woods, but in some
places plaine: at length we were come amongst
many faire Islands, which we had partly discerned
at our first landing; <span class="sidenote"><i>Nantucket</i></span>all lying within a
league or two one of another, and the outermost
not aboue sixe or seuen leagues from the
maine: <span class="sidenote"><i>Martha’s Vineyard</i></span>but comming to an anker vnder one of
them, which was about three or foure leagues
from the maine, captaine <em>Gosnold</em>, my selfe, and
some others, went ashore, &amp; going round about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
it, we found it to be foure English miles in
compasse, without house or inhabitant, sauing a
little old house made of boughes, couered with
barke, an olde piece of a weare of the Indians,
to catch fish, and one or two places, where they
had made fires. The chiefest trees of this Island,
are Beeches and Cedars; the outward parts all
ouergrowen with lowe bushie trees, three or
foure foot in height, which beare some kinde
of fruits, as appeared by their blossomes; Strawberies,
red and white, as sweet and much bigger
than ours in <em>England</em>, Rasberies, Gooseberies,
Hurtleberies, and such; an incredible store of
Vines, as well in the wooddie part of the Island,
where they run upon euery tree, as on the outward
parts, that we could not goe for treading
vpon them: also, many springs of excellent
sweet water, and a great standing lake of fresh
water, neere the sea side, an English mile in
compasse, which is mainteined with the springs
running exceeding pleasantly thorow the wooddie
grounds which are very rockie. Here are
also in this Island, great store of Deere, which
we saw, and other beasts, as appeared by their
tracks; as also diuers fowles, as Cranes, Hernshawes,
Bitters, Geese, Mallards, Teales, and
other fowles, in great plenty; also, great store of
Pease, which grow in certeine plots all the Island
ouer. On the North side of this Island we
found many huge bones and ribbes of Whales.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
This Island, as also all the rest of these Islands,
are full of all sorts of stones fit for building; the
sea sides all couered with stones, many of them
glistering and shining like minerall stones, and
very rockie: also, the rest of these Islands are
replenished with these commodities, and vpon
some of them, inhabitants; as vpon an Island
to the Northward, and within two leagues of
this; yet wee found no townes, nor many of their
houses, although we saw manie Indians, which
are tall big boned men, all naked, sauing they
couer their priuy parts with a blacke tewed skin,
much like a Black-smithes apron, tied about
their middle and betweene their legs behinde:
they gaue vs of their fish readie boiled (which
they carried in a basket made of twigges, not
unlike our osier) whereof we did eat, and iudged
them to be fresh water fish: they gaue vs also
of their Tabacco, which they drinke greene,
but dried into powder, very strong and pleasant,
and much better than any I haue tasted in
<em>England</em>: the necks of their pipes are made of
clay hard dried (whereof in that Island is great
store both red and white) the other part, is a
piece of hollow copper, very finely closed and
semented together: we gaue vnto them certeine
trifles, as kniues, points, and such like, which
they much esteemed. From hence we went to
another Island, to the Northwest of this, and
within a league or two of the maine, which we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
found to be greater than before we imagined,
being 16 English miles at the least in compasse; <span class="sidenote"><i>Cuttyhunk</i></span>
for it conteineth many pieces or necks of
land, which differ nothing frō seuerall Islands,
sauing that certeine banks of small bredth do
like bridges ioyne them to this Island: on the
outsides of this Island are many plaine places
of grasse, abundance of Strawberies &amp; other
berries before mentioned: in mid May we did
sowe in this Island (as for a triall) in sundry
places, Wheat, Barley, Oats, and Pease, which in
foureteene daies were sprung up nine inches and
more: the soile is fat and lustie; the vpper crust,
of gray colour; but a foot or lesse in depth, of
the colour of our hempe-lands in <em>England</em>; and
being thus apt for these and the like graines; the
sowing or setting (after the ground is cleansed)
is no greater labour, than if you should set or
sowe in one of our best prepared gardens in England.
This Island is full of high timberd Oaks,
their leaues thrise so broad as ours; Cedars, strait
and tall; Beech, Elme, Hollie, Walnut trees in
abundance, the fruit as bigge as ours, as appeared
by those we found under the trees, which had
lien all the yeere vngathered; Haslenut trees,
Cherry trees, the leafe, barke and bignesse not
differing from ours in <em>England</em>, but the stalke
beareth the blossomes or fruit at the end thereof,
like a cluster of Grapes, forty or fifty in a bunch;
Sassafras trees great plentie all the Island ouer, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
tree of high price and profit; also, diuers other
fruit trees, some of them with strange barks, of
an Orange colour, in feeling soft and smoothe
like veluet: in the thickest parts of these woods,
you may see a furlong or more round about.
On the Northwest side of this Island, neere to
the sea side, is a standing Lake of fresh water,
almost three English miles in compasse, in
the middest whereof stands a plot of wooddie
ground, an acre in quantitie or not aboue: this
Lake is full of small Tortoises, and exceedingly
frequented with all sorts of fowles before rehearsed,
which breed, some lowe on the banks,
and others on lowe trees about this Lake in
great abundance, whose yoong ones of all sorts
we tooke and eat at our pleasure: but all these
fowles are much bigger than ours in <em>England</em>.
Also, in euery Island, and almost in euery part
of euery Island, are great store of Ground nuts,
fortie together on a string, some of them as
bigge as hennes egges; they grow not two inches
vnder ground: the which nuts we found to be
as good as Potatoes. Also, diuers sorts of shell-fish,
as Scallops, Muscles, Cockles, Lobsters,
Crabs, Oisters, and Wilks, exceeding good and
very great. But not to cloy you with particular
rehearsall of such things as God &amp; Nature hath
bestowed on these places, in comparison whereof,
the most fertil part of al <em>England</em> is (of it
selfe) but barren; we went in our light-horsman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
frō this Island to the maine, right against this
Island some two leagues off, where comming
ashore, we stood a while like men rauished at
the beautie and delicacie of this sweet soile; <span class="sidenote"><i>Buzzard’s Bay</i></span>
for besides diuers cleere Lakes of fresh water
(whereof we saw no end) Medowes very large
and full of greene grasse; euen the most wooddy
places (I speake onely of such as I saw) doe grow
so distinct and apart, one tree from another,
vpon greene grassie ground, somewhat higher
than the Plaines, as if Nature would shew herselfe
aboue her power, artificiall. Hard by, we
espied seuen Indians; and comming vp to them,
at first they expressed some feare; but being
emboldned by our courteous vsage, and some
trifles which we gaue them, they followed vs to
a necke of land, which we imagined had beene
seuered from the maine; but finding it otherwise,
we perceiued a broad harbour or riuers
mouth, which ranne vp into the maine: but
because the day was farre spent, we were forced
to returne to the Island from whence we came,
leauing the discouerie of this harbour, for a
time of better leasure: of the goodnesse of which
harbour, as also of many others thereabouts,
there is small doubt, considering that all the
Islands, as also the maine (where we were) is all
rockie grounds and broken lands. Now the
next day, we determined to fortifie our selues
in the little plot of ground in the midst of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Lake aboue mentioned, where we built an house,
and couered it with sedge, which grew about
this lake in great abundance; in building whereof,
we spent three weeks and more: but the
second day after our comming from the maine,
we espied 9 canowes or boats, with fiftie Indians
in them, comming toward vs from this part of
the maine, where we, two daies before, landed;
and being loth they should discouer our fortification,
we went out on the sea side to meet
them; and comming somewhat neere them,
they all sat downe upon the stones, calling aloud
to vs (as we rightly ghessed) to doe the like, a
little distance from them: hauing sat a while
in this order, captaine <em>Gosnold</em> willed me to go
vnto them, to see what countenance they would
make; but as soone as I came vp vnto them,
one of them, to whom I had giuen a knife two
daies before in the maine, knew me (whom I
also very wel remembred) and smiling vpon me,
spake somewhat vnto their lord or captaine,
which sat in the midst of them, who presently
rose vp and tooke a large Beauer skin from one
that stood about him, and gaue it vnto me,
which I requited for that time the best I could:
but I pointing towards captaine <em>Gosnold</em>, made
signes vnto him, that he was our captaine, and
desirous to be his friend, and enter league with
him, which (as I perceiued) he vnderstood, and
made signes of ioy: whereupon captaine <em>Gosnold</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
with the rest of his companie, being
twentie in all, came vp vnto them; and after
many signes of gratulations (captain <em>Gosnold</em>
presenting their L. with certeine trifles which
they wondred at, and highly esteemed) we
became very great friends, and sent for meat
aboord our shallop, and gaue them such meats
as we had then readie dressed, whereof they
misliked nothing but our mustard, whereat they
made many a sowre face. While wee were thus
merry, one of them had conueied a target of ours
into one of their canowes, which we suffered,
onely to trie whether they were in subiection
to this L. to whom we made signes (by shewing
him another of the same likenesse, and
pointing to the canowe) what one of his companie
had done: who suddenly expressed some
feare, and speaking angerly to one about him
(as we perceiued by his countenance) caused it
presently to be brought backe againe. So the
rest of the day we spent in trading with them
for Furres, which are Beauers, Luzernes, Marterns,
Otters, Wild-cat skinnes very large and
deepe Furre, blacke Foxes, Conie skinnes, of
the colour of our Hares, but somewhat lesse,
Deere skinnes very large, Seale skinnes, and
other beasts skinnes, to vs vnknowen. They
haue also great store of Copper, some very
redde, and some of a paler colour; none of them
but haue chaines, earrings or collars of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
mettall: they head some of their arrows herewith,
much like our broad arrow heads, very
workmanly made. Their chaines are many
hollow pieces semented together, ech piece of
the bignesse of one of our reeds, a finger in
length, ten or twelue of them together on a
string, which they weare about their necks:
their collars they weare about their bodies like
bandelieres a handfull broad, all hollow pieces,
like the other, but somewhat shorter, foure
hundred pieces in a collar, very fine and euenly
set together. Besides these, they haue large
drinking cups, made like sculles, and other
thinne plates of Copper, made much like our
boare-speare blades, all which they so little
esteeme, as they offered their fairest collars or
chaines, for a knife or such like trifle, but
we seemed little to regard it; yet I was desirous
to vnderstand where they had such store of
this mettall, and made signes to one of them
(with whom I was verie familiar) who taking a
piece of Copper in his hand, made a hole with
his finger in the ground, and withall, pointed
to the maine from whence they came. They
strike fire in this manner; euery one carrieth
about him in a purse of tewed leather, a Minerall
stone (which I take to be their Copper) and
with a flat Emerie stone (wherewith Glasiers
cut glasse, and Cutlers glase blades) tied fast
to the end of a little sticke, gently he striketh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
vpon the Minerall stone, and within a stroke
or two, a sparke falleth vpon a piece of Touch-wood
(much like our Spunge in <em>England</em>) and
with the least sparke he maketh a fire presently.
We had also of their Flaxe, wherewith they
make many strings and cords, but it is not so
bright of colour as ours in England: I am perswaded
they haue great store growing vpon
the maine, as also Vines and many other rich
commodities, which we, wanting both time and
meanes, could not possibly discouer. Thus they
continued with vs three daies, euery night retiring
themselues to the furthermost part of our
Island two or three miles from our fort: but the
fourth day they returned to the maine, pointing
fiue or six times to the Sun, and once to the
maine, which we vnderstood, that within fiue
or six daies they would come from the maine
to vs againe: but being in their canowes a little
from the shore, they made huge cries &amp; shouts
of ioy vnto vs; and we with our trumpet and
cornet, and casting vp our cappes into the aire,
made them the best farewell we could: yet sixe
or seuen of them remained with vs behinde,
bearing vs company euery day into the woods,
and helpt vs to cut and carie our Sassafras,
and some of them lay aboord our ship. These
people, as they are exceeding courteous, gentle
of disposition, and well conditioned, excelling
all others that we haue seene; so for shape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
of bodie and louely fauour, I thinke they excell
all the people of <em>America</em>; of stature much
higher than we; of complexion or colour,
much like a darke Oliue; their eie-browes and
haire blacke, which they weare long, tied vp
behinde in knots, whereon they pricke feathers
of fowles, in fashion of a crownet: some of
them are blacke thin bearded; they make beards
of the haire of beasts: and one of them offered
a beard of their making to one of our sailers,
for his that grew on his face, which because it
was of a red colour, they iudged to be none of
his owne. They are quicke eied, and stedfast
in their looks, fearelesse of others harmes, as intending
none themselues; some of the meaner
sort giuen to filching, which the very name of
Saluages (not weighing their ignorance in good
or euill) may easily excuse: their garments are
of Deere skins, and some of them weare Furres
round and close about their necks. They pronounce
our language with great facilitie; for
one of them one day sitting by me, vpon occasion
I spake smiling to him these words: <em>How
now (sirha) are you so saucie with my Tabacco</em>:
which words (without any further repetition)
he suddenly spake so plaine and distinctly, as if
he had beene a long scholar in the language.
Many other such trials we had, which are heere
needlesse to repeat. Their women (such as we
saw) which were but three in all, were but lowe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
of stature, their eie-browes, haire, apparell, and
maner of wearing, like to the men, fat, and very
well fauoured, and much delighted in our compane;
the men are very dutifull towards them.
And truely, the holsomnesse and temperature
of this Climat, doth not onely argue this people
to be answerable to this description, but also
of a perfect constitution of body, actiue, strong,
healthfull, and very wittie, as the sundry toies
of theirs cunningly wrought, may easily witnes.
For the agreeing of this Climat with vs
(I speake of my selfe, &amp; so I may iustly do for
the rest of our companie) that we found our
health &amp; strength all the while we remained
there, so to renew and increase, as notwithstanding
our diet and lodging was none of the
best, yet not one of our company (God be
thanked) felt the least grudging or inclination
to any disease or sicknesse, but were much fatter
and in better health than when we went out
of <em>England</em>. But after our barke had taken in
so much Sassafras, Cedar, Furres, Skinnes, and
other commodities, as were thought conuenient;
some of our company that had promised
captaine <em>Gosnold</em> to stay, hauing nothing but
a sauing voyage in their minds, made our company
of inhabitants (which was small enough
before) much smaller; so as captaine <em>Gosnold</em>
seeing his whole strength to consist but of
twelue men, and they but meanly prouided,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
determined to returne for <em>England</em>, leauing this
Island (which he called <em>Elizabeths Island</em>) with
as many true sorrowfull eies, as were before
desirous to see it. So the 18 of June, being Friday,
we weighed, and with indifferent faire
winde and weather came to anker the 23 of
July, being also Friday (in all, bare fiue weeks)
before <em>Exmouth</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Martin Pring</span>, <em>who became more famous ten years
later in the East India trade, and who rose to the dignity
of “Generall to the Fraternity of the Trinitie House” at
Bristol, was selected by sundry of the chiefest merchants
of that town in 1603 to represent their interests on a
voyage to the region where Gosnold and Gilbert had
gathered a profitable cargo of sassafras. He was given
the charge of “a small ship called the Speed-well in burthen
about fiftie tunnes, manning the same with some
thirtie men and Boyes ... with a Barke called the Discoverer,
of six and twentie tunnes or thereabout, being
thirteene men and a Boy in all in that Barke.” They
made land on the Maine coast, and after following the
northern shore of Massachusetts Bay for a ways, struck
across to the southwest, hitting upon Plymouth harbour.
Here there was abundance of sassafras, and the ships’
companies made a camp on shore while they gathered
their cargo.</em></p>

<p><em>Pring wrote an account of the voyage for Richard
Hakluyt, who had persuaded the Bristol merchants to
make the venture. Samuel Purchas, who came into possession
of Hakluyt’s papers, printed the narrative at
London in 1625, in the fourth volume of “Purchas his
Pilgrimes.”</em></p>

set out from the Citie of
<em>Bristoll</em> at the charge of the
chiefest Merchants and Inhabitants
of the said Citie
with a small Ship and a Barke
for the discouerie of the
North part of <em>Virginia</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE set saile from <em>Milford Hauen</em> <span class="sidenote"><i>April 1603</i></span>
(where the winds had stayed vs a
fortnight, in which space we heard
of Queen <em>Elizabeths</em> death) the tenth of Aprill
1603. In our course we passed by the Iles of
the <em>Açores</em>, had first sight of the <em>Pike</em>, and afterward
of the Iland of <em>Cueruo</em> and <em>Flores</em>, and after
we had runne some fiue hundred leagues, <span class="sidenote"><i>June</i></span>we fell
with a multitude of small Ilands on the North
Coast of <em>Virginia</em>, in the latitude of 43. degrees,
the ······· of Iune, which Ilands wee found very
pleasant to behold, adorned with goodly grasse
and sundry sorts of Trees, as Cedars, Spruce,
Pines, and Firre-trees. Heere wee found an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
excellent fishing for Cods, which are better then
those of <em>New-found-land</em>, and withall we saw
good and Rockie ground fit to drie them vpon:
also we see no reason to the contrary, but that
Salt may bee made in these parts, a matter of
no small importance. We sayled to the South-west
end of these Ilands, and there rode with
our ships vnder one of the greatest. One of them
we named <em>Foxe Iland</em>, because we found those
kind of beasts thereon. So passing through the
rest with our Boates to the mayne Land, which
lieth for a good space North-east and South-west,
we found very safe riding among them,
in sixe, seuen, eight, ten and twelue fathomes.
At length comming to the Mayne in the latitude
of 43. degrees and an halfe, we ranged the same
to the South-west. In which course we found
foure Inlets, the most Easterly whereof was
barred at the mouth, but hauing passed ouer the
barre, wee ranne vp into it fiue miles, and for a
certaine space found very good depth, and comming
out againe, as we sailed South-westward,
we lighted vpon two other Inlets, which vpon
our search we found to pierce not farre into the
Land, the fourth and most Westerly was the
best, which we rowed vp ten or twelue miles.</p>

<p>In all these places we found no people, but
signes of fires where they had beene. Howbeit we
beheld very goodly Groues and Woods replenished
with tall Okes, Beeches, Pine-trees, Firre-trees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Hasels, Wich-hasels and Maples. We saw
here also sundry sorts of Beasts, as Stags, Deere,
Beares, Wolues, Foxes, Lusernes, and Dogges
with sharpe noses. But meeting with no Sassafras,
we left these places with all the foresaid
Ilands, <span class="sidenote"><i>Cape Neddock Nubble</i></span>shaping our course for <em>Sauage Rocke</em> discouered
the yeere before by Captaine <em>Gosnold</em>,
where going vpon the Mayne we found people,
with whom we had no long conuersation,
because here also we could find no Sassafras.
Departing hence we bare into that great Gulfe
which Captaine <em>Gosnold</em> ouer-shot the yeere before,
coasting and finding people on the North
side thereof. Not yet satisfied in our expectation,
we left them and sailed ouer, and came to
an Anchor on the South side in the latitude of
41. degrees and odde minute: where we went
on Land in a certaine Bay, <span class="sidenote"><i>Plymouth Harbour</i></span>which we called
<em>Whitson Bay</em>, by the name of the Worshipfull
Master <em>Iohn Whitson</em> then Maior of the Citie
of <em>Bristoll</em>, and one of the chiefe Aduenturers,
and finding a pleasant Hill thereunto adioyning,
wee called it <em>Mount Aldworth</em>, for Master <em>Robert
Aldworths</em> sake a chiefe furtherer of the Voyage,
as well with his Purse as with his trauell. Here
we had sufficient quantitie of Sassafras.</p>

<p>At our going on shore, vpon view of the
people and sight of the place, wee thought it
conuenient to make a small baricado to keepe
diligent watch and ward in, for the aduertizement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
and succour of our men, while they should
worke in the Woods. During our abode on
shore, the people of the Countrey came to our
men sometimes ten, twentie, fortie or threescore,
and at one time one hundred and twentie
at once. We vsed them kindly, and gaue them
diuers sorts of our meanest Merchandize. They
did eat Pease and Beanes with our men. Their
owne victuals were most of fish.</p>

<p>We had a youth in our company that could
play vpon a Gitterne, in whose homely Musicke
they tooke great delight, and would giue
him many things, as Tobacco, Tobacco-pipes,
Snakes skinnes of sixe foot long, which they
vse for Girdles, Fawnes skinnes, and such like,
and danced twentie in a Ring, and the Gitterne
in the middest of them, vsing many Sauage
gestures, singing <em>lo, la, lo, la, la, lo</em>: him that
first brake the ring, the rest would knocke and
cry out vpon. Some few of them had plates
of Brasse a foot long, and halfe a foote broad
before their breasts. Their weapons are Bowes
of fiue or sixe foot long of Wich-hasell, painted
blacke and yellow, the strings of three twists
of sinewes, bigger then our Bow-strings. Their
Arrowes are of a yard and an handfull long not
made of Reeds, but of a fine light wood very
smooth and round with three long and deepe
blacke feathers of some Eagle, Vulture, or Kite,
as closely fastened with some binding matter, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
any Fletcher of ours can glue them on. Their
Quiuers are full a yard long, made of long
dried Rushes wrought about two handfuls broad
aboue, and one handfull beneath with prettie
workes and compartiments, Diamant wise of
red and other colours.</p>

<p>We carried with vs from <em>Bristoll</em> two excellent
Mastiues, of whom the <em>Indians</em> were more
afraid, then of twentie of our men. One of
these Mastiues would carrie a halfe Pike in
his mouth. And one Master <em>Thomas Bridges</em> a
Gentleman of our company accompanied only
with one of these Dogs, and passed sixe miles
alone in the Countrey hauing lost his fellowes,
and returned safely. And when we would be
rid of the Sauages company wee would let loose
the Mastiues, and suddenly with out-cryes they
would flee away. These people in colour are
inclined to a swart, tawnie, or Chestnut colour,
not by nature but accidentally, and doe weare
their haire brayded in foure parts, and trussed
vp about their heads with a small knot behind:
in which haire of theirs they sticke many feathers
and toyes for brauerie and pleasure. They
couer their priuities only with a piece of leather
drawne betwixt their twists and fastened to
their Girdles behind and before: whereunto
they hang their bags of Tobacco. They seeme
to bee somewhat iealous of their women, for we
saw not past two of them, who weare Aprons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
of Leather skins before them downe to the
knees, and a Beares skinne like an <em>Irish</em> Mantle
ouer one shoulder. The men are of stature somewhat
taller then our ordinary people, strong,
swift, well proportioned, and giuen to treacherie,
as in the end we perceiued.</p>

<p>Their Boats, whereof we brought one to
<em>Bristoll</em>, were in proportion like a Wherrie of
the Riuer of <em>Thames</em>, seuenteene foot long and
foure foot broad, made of the Barke of a Birch-tree,
farre exceeding in bignesse those of <em>England</em>:
it was sowed together with strong and
tough Oziers or twigs, and the seames couered
ouer with Rozen or Turpentine little inferiour
in sweetnesse to Frankincense, as we made triall
by burning a little thereof on the coales at
sundry times after our coming home: it was
also open like a Wherrie, and sharpe at both
ends, sauing that the beake was a little bending
roundly vpward. And though it carried nine
men standing vpright, yet it weighed not at
the most aboue sixtie pounds in weight, a thing
almost incredible in regard of the largenesse
and capacitie thereof. Their Oares were flat at
the end like an Ouen peele, made of Ash or
Maple very light and strong, about two yards
long, wherewith they row very swiftly: Passing
vp a Riuer we saw certaine Cottages together,
abandoned by the Sauages, and not farre off
we beheld their Gardens and one among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
rest of an Acre of ground, and in the same was
sowne Tobacco, Pompions, Cowcumbers and
such like; and some of the people had Maiz or
<em>Indian</em> Wheate among them. In the fields we
found wild Pease, Strawberries very faire and
bigge, Gooseberries, Raspices, Hurts, and other
wild fruits.</p>

<p>Hauing spent three Weeks vpon the Coast
before we came to this place where we meant
to stay and take in our lading, according to our
instructions giuen vs in charge before our setting
forth, we pared and digged vp the Earth
with shouels, and sowed Wheate, Barley, Oates,
Pease, and sundry sorts of Garden Seeds, which
for the time of our abode there, being about
seuen Weeks, although they were late sowne,
came vp very well, giuing certaine testimonie
of the goodnesse of the Climate and of the
Soyle. And it seemeth that Oade, Hempe,
Flaxe, Rape-seed and such like which require a
rich and fat ground, would prosper excellently
in these parts. For in diuers places here we
found grasse aboue knee deepe.</p>

<p>As for Trees the Country yeeldeth Sassafras
a plant of souereigne vertue for the <em>French</em>
Poxe, and as some of late haue learnedly written
good against the Plague and many other

with, and a kinde of tree bearing a fruit like a
small red Peare-plum with a crowne or knop
on the top (a plant whereof carefully wrapped
vp in earth, Master <em>Robert Salterne</em> brought to
Bristoll.) We found also low trees bearing faire
Cheries. There were likewise a white kind
of Plums which were growne to their perfect
ripenesse. With diuers other sorts of trees to
vs vnknowne.</p>

<p>The Beasts here are Stags, fallow Deere in
abundance, Beares, Wolues, Foxes, Lusernes, and
(some say) Tygres, Porcupines, and Dogges with
sharpe and long noses, with many other sorts
of wild beasts, whose Cases and Furres being
hereafter purchased by exchange may yeeld no
smal gaine to vs. Since as we are certainly informed,
the <em>Frenchmen</em> brought from <em>Canada</em> the
value of thirtie thousand Crownes in the yeare
1604. Almost in Beuers and Otters skinnes
only. The most vsuall Fowles are Eagles, Vultures,
Hawkes, Cranes, Herons, Crowes, Gulls,
and great store of other Riuer and Sea-fowles.
And as the Land is full of Gods good blessings,
so is the Sea replenished with great abundance
of excellent fish, as Cods sufficient to lade many
ships, which we found vpon the Coast in the
moneth of Iune, Seales to make Oile withall,
Mullets, Turbuts, Mackerels, Herrings, Crabs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
Lobsters, Creuises and Muscles with ragged
Pearles in them.</p>

<p>By the end of Iuly we had laded our small
Barke called the Discouerer, <span class="sidenote"><i>July</i></span>with as much Sassafras
as we thought sufficient, and sent her home
into <em>England</em> before, to giue some speedie contentment
to the Aduenturers; who arriued safely
in <em>Kingrode</em> aboue a fortnight before vs. After
their departure we so bestirred our selues, that
our shippe also had gotten in her lading, during
which time there fell out this accident. On a
day about noone tide while our men which vsed
to cut down Sassafras in the Woods were asleepe,
as they vsed to doe for two houres in the heat
of the day, there came downe about seuen score
Sauages armed with their Bowes and Arrowes,
and enuironed our House or Barricado, wherein
were foure of our men alone with their Muskets
to keepe Centinell, whom they sought to haue
come downe vnto them, which they vtterly
refused, and stood vpon their guard. Our Master
likewise being very carefull and circumspect
hauing not past two with him in the shippe put
the same in the best defence he could, lest they
should haue inuaded the same, and caused a
piece of great Ordnance to bee shot off, to giue
terrour to the <em>Indians</em>, and warning to our men
which were fast asleepe in the Woods: at the
noyse of which Peece they were a little awaked,
and beganne a little to call for <em>Foole</em> and <em>Gallant</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
their great and fearefull Mastiues, and full quietly
laid themselues downe againe, but beeing
quickned vp eftsoones againe with a second shot
they rowsed vp themselues, betooke them to
their weapons and with their Mastiues, great
<em>Foole</em> with an halfe Pike in his mouth drew
downe to their ship: whom when the <em>Indians</em>
beheld afarre off, with the Mastiue which they
most feared, in dissembling manner they turned
all to a iest and sport, and departed away in
friendly manner: yet not long after, euen the
day before our departure, they set fire on the
Woods where wee wrought, which wee did
behold to burne for a mile space, and the very
same day that wee weighed Anchor, they came
downe to the shoare in greater number, to wit,
very neere two hundred by our estimation, and
some of them came in their Boates to our ship,
and would haue had vs come in againe: but
we sent them backe, and would none of their
entertainment.</p>

<p>About the eighth or ninth of August, <span class="sidenote"><i>August</i></span>wee
left this excellent Hauen at the entrance whereof
we found twentie fathomes water, and rode
at our ease in seuen fathomes being Land-locked,
the Hauen winding in compasse like the shell
of a Snaile, and it is in latitude of one and forty
degrees and fiue and twentie minutes.</p>

<p>This by the way is not to be forgotten, that
our Captaine fell so much to the Northward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
because he would find high grounds, where
commonly the best Hauens are: which also
fell out to his expectation. We also obserued
that we could find no Sassafras but in sandie
ground. In our returne we brought our selues
into the latitude of eight and thirtie degrees
about the <em>Açores</em> for certaine causes, and within
fiue weekes space came from our Port of <em>Virginia</em>,
into the Soundings of <em>England</em>, but there
being long encountred with Easterly winds, we
came at length into <em>Kingrode</em>, the second of
October 1603. The Discouerer was out fiue
moneths and an halfe. The <i>Speedwell</i> was out
sixe moneths vpon the Voyage.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Samuel de Champlain</span> <em>first demonstrated his talents
as an observer of unfamiliar regions during a two years’
trip through the West Indies and to the City of Mexico.
His report on these travels doubtless commended him to
the French king, who appointed him in 1603 to accompany
an expedition which visited the St. Lawrence in
search of a suitable location for a settlement. The following
year Champlain made another voyage to America
with Sieur de Monts, who attempted to plant a colony
in Nova Scotia. The location proving unsatisfactory,
Champlain made three voyages toward the west, hoping
to find a place more to his liking. In September, 1604,
he visited Mount Desert, and sailed up the Penobscot as
far as Bangor. In the summer of 1605 he sailed along
the Maine and Massachusetts coasts as far as Nauset
harbour on the outer shores of Cape Cod. In 1606 he
continued his explorations, visiting Gloucester harbour,
then crossing to Cape Cod, and following the coast around
to Vineyard Sound.</em></p>

<p><em>Champlain made careful notes of all his observations,
drawing maps and sketches of all important points. His
reports were afterwards written out and sent home to
France, where they were printed, the volumes going
through several editions. An English translation of
Champlain’s writings, by Dr. Charles P. Otis, with
editorial notes by the Rev. E. F. Slafter, was issued
in 1878 by the Prince Society of Boston, by whose courtesy
that translation of chapters vii, viii, and ix of
Champlain’s “Voyages,” printed at Paris in 1613, is
now reprinted with some verbal changes.</em></p>

this Voyage.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the 18th of the month of June,
1605, <span class="sidenote"><i>1605 June</i></span>Sieur de Monts set out from
the Island of St. Croix with some
gentlemen, twenty sailors, and a savage named
Panounias, together with his wife, whom he
was unwilling to leave behind. These we took,
in order to serve us as guides to the country of
the Almouchiquois, in the hope of exploring
and learning more particularly by their aid
what the character of this country was, especially
since she was a native of it.</p>

<p>Coasting along inside of Manan, <span class="sidenote"><i>Manan Island</i></span>an island
three leagues from the main land, we came to
the Ranges on the seaward side, at one of which
we anchored, where there was a large number
of crows, of which our men captured a great
many, and we called it the Isle aux Corneilles.
Thence we went to the Island of Monts Deserts,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Mount Desert</i></span>at the entrance of the river Norumbegue,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
as I have before stated, and sailed five or six
leagues among many islands. <span class="sidenote"><i>Mouth of Penobscot River</i></span>Here there came
to us three savages in a canoe from Bedabedec
Point, where their captain was; and, after we
had had some conversation with them, they
returned the same day.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 1st of July, <span class="sidenote"><i>July</i></span>we set out from
one of the islands at the mouth of the river,
where there is a very good harbour for vessels
of a hundred or a hundred and fifty tons. This
day we made some twenty-five leagues between
Bedabedec Point and many islands and rocks,
which we explored as far as the river Quinibequy, <span class="sidenote"><i>Kennebec River</i></span>
at the mouth of which is a very high
island, which we called the Tortoise. <span class="sidenote"><i>Seguin Island</i></span>Between
the latter and the main land there are some
scattering rocks, which are covered at full tide,
although the sea is then seen to break over
them. Tortoise Island and the river lie south-south-east
and north-north-west. As you enter,
there are two medium-sized islands forming the
entrance, one on one side, the other on the
other; and some three hundred paces farther
in are two rocks, where there is no wood, but
some little grass. We anchored three hundred
paces from the entrance in five and six fathoms
of water. While in this place, we were overtaken
by fogs, on account of which we resolved
to enter, in order to see the upper part of the
river and the savages who live there; and we set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
out for this purpose on the 5th of the month.
Having made some leagues, our barque came
near being lost on a rock which we grazed in
passing. Further on, <span class="sidenote"><i>Back River</i></span>we met two canoes which
had come to hunt birds, which for the most
part are moulting at this season, and cannot
fly. We addressed these savages by aid of our
own, who went to them with his wife, who
made them understand the reason of our coming.
We made friends with them and with the
savages of this river, who served us as guides.
Proceeding farther, in order to see their captain,
named Manthoumermer, we passed, after
we had gone seven or eight leagues, by some
islands, straits, and brooks, <span class="sidenote"><i>Hockamock Bay</i></span>which extend along
the river, where we saw some fine meadows.
After we had coasted along an island some four
leagues in length, <span class="sidenote"><i>Westport Island</i></span>they conducted us to where
their chief was with twenty-five or thirty savages,
who as soon as we had anchored, <span class="sidenote"><i>Wiscasset Harbour</i></span>came to
us in a canoe, separated a short distance from
ten others, in which were those who accompanied
him. Coming near our barque, he made
an harangue, in which he expressed the pleasure
it gave him to see us, and said that he desired
to form an alliance with us and to make
peace with his enemies through our mediation.
He said that, on the next day, he would send
to two other captains of savages, who were in
the interior, one called Marchin, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
Sasinou, chief of the river Quinibequy. Sieur
de Monts gave them some cakes and peas, with
which they were greatly pleased. The next day
they guided us down the river another way than
that by which we had come, in order to go to
a lake; and, passing by some islands, they left,
each one of them, an arrow near a cape, <span class="sidenote"><i>Hockamock Point</i></span>where
all the savages pass, and they believe that if they
should not do this some misfortune would befall
them, according to the persuasions of the
devil. They live in such superstitions, and practice
many others of the same sort. Beyond this
cape we passed a very narrow waterfall, <span class="sidenote"><i>Hell Gate</i></span>but not
without great difficulty; for, although we had
a favorable and fresh wind, and trimmed our
sails to receive it as well as possible, in order to
see whether we could not pass it in that way, we
were obliged to attach a hawser to some trees
on shore and all pull on it. In this way, by
means of our arms, together with the help of
the wind, which was favourable to us, we succeeded
in passing it. The savages who were with
us carried their canoes by land, being unable
to row them. After going over this fall, we saw
some fine meadows. I was greatly surprised by
this fall, since as we descended with the tide we
found it in our favour, but contrary to us when
we came to the fall. But, after we had passed
it, it descended as before, which gave us great
satisfaction. Pursuing our route, we came to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
the lake, <span class="sidenote"><i>Merrymeeting Bay</i></span>which is from three to four leagues
in length, where there are some islands, and
two rivers enter it, the Quinibequy coming
from the north-north-east, and the other from
the north-west, <span class="sidenote"><i>Kennebec and Androscoggin Rivers</i></span>whence Marchin and Sasinou
were to come. Having awaited them all this
day, and seeing that they did not come, we
resolved to improve our time. We weighed
anchor accordingly, and there accompanied us
two savages from this lake to serve as guides.
The same day we anchored at the mouth of
the river, where we caught a large number of
excellent fish of various sorts. Meanwhile, our
savages went hunting, but did not return. The
route by which we descended this river is much
safer and better than that by which we went up.
Tortoise Island before the mouth of this river
is in latitude 44°; and 19° 12′ of the deflection
of the magnetic needle. <span class="sidenote"><i>Real latitude 43° 42′ 25″</i></span>They go by this river
across the country to Quebec some fifty leagues,
making only one portage of two leagues. After
the portage, you enter another little stream <span class="sidenote"><i>Chaudière River</i></span>
which flows into the great river St. Lawrence.
This river Quinibequy is very dangerous for vessels
half a league from its mouth, on account of
the small amount of water, great tides, rocks
and shoals that are there outside as well as
within. But it has a good channel, if it were
well marked out. The little of the country
which I have seen, along the shores of the river,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
is very poor, for there are only rocks on all sides.
There are a great many small oaks, and very
little arable land. This place abounds in fish,
as do the other rivers which I have mentioned.
The people live like those in the neighbourhood
of our settlement; and they told us that
the savages who plant the Indian corn dwelt
very far in the interior, and that they had given
up planting it on the coasts on account of the
war they had with others, who came and took
it away. This is what I have been able to learn
about this region, which I think is no better
than the others.</p>

<p>On the 8th of the month, we set out from
the mouth of this river, which we could not
do sooner on account of the fogs. We made
that day some four leagues, and passed a bay, <span class="sidenote"><i>Casco Bay</i></span>
where there are a great many islands. From
here large mountains are seen to the west, <span class="sidenote"><i>White Mountains</i></span>in
which is the dwelling-place of a savage captain
called Aneda, who encamps near the river
Quinibequy. I was satisfied from this name
that it was one of his tribe that had discovered
the plant called Aneda, which Jacques Cartier
said was so powerful against the malady called
scurvy, of which we have already spoken, which
harassed his company as well as our own, when
they wintered in Canada. The savages have
no knowledge whatever of this plant, and are
not aware of its existence, although the above-mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
savage has the same name. The
following day we made eight leagues. As we
passed along the coast, we perceived two columns
of smoke which some savages made to
attract our attention. We went in the direction
of them and anchored behind a small island
near the main land, <span class="sidenote"><i>Prout’s Neck</i></span>where we saw more than
eighty savages running along the shore to see
us, dancing and giving expression to their joy.
Sieur de Monts sent two men together with our
savage to visit them. After they had spoken
some time with them, and assured them of
our friendship, we left with them one of our
number, and they delivered to us one of their
companions as a hostage. Meanwhile, Sieur
de Monts visited an island, <span class="sidenote"><i>Richmond Island</i></span>which is very beautiful
in view of what it produces; for it has
fine oaks and nut-trees, the soil cleared up, and
many vineyards bearing beautiful grapes in their
season, which were the first we had seen on all
these coasts from the Cap de la Hève. We
named it Isle de Bacchus. It being full tide,
we weighed anchor and entered a little river,
which we could not sooner do; <span class="sidenote"><i>Saco River</i></span>for there is a
bar, there being at low tide only half a fathom
of water, at full tide a fathom and a half, and
at the highest water two fathoms. On the other
side of the bar there are three, four, five, and
six fathoms. When we had anchored, a large
number of savages came to us on the bank of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the river, and began to dance. Their captain,
whom they called Honemechin, was not with
them at the time. He arrived about two or
three hours later with two canoes, when he
came sweeping entirely round our barque. Our
savage could understand only a few words, as
the language of the Almouchiquois (as this
nation is called) differs entirely from that of
the Souriquois and Etechemins. These people
gave signs of being greatly pleased. Their
chief had a good figure, was young and agile.
We sent some articles of merchandise on shore
to barter with them; but they had nothing
but their robes to give in exchange, for they
preserve only such furs as they need for their
garments. Sieur de Monts ordered some provisions
to be given to their chief, with which he
was greatly pleased, and came several times to
the side of our boat to see us. These savages
shave off the hair far up on the head, and wear
what remains very long, which they comb and
twist behind in various ways very neatly, intertwined
with feathers which they attach to the
head. They paint their faces black and red, like
the other savages which we have seen. They
are an agile people, with well-formed bodies.
Their weapons are pikes, clubs, bows and arrows,
at the end of which some attach the tail
of a fish called the signoc, others bones, while
the arrows of others are entirely of wood. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
till and cultivate the soil, something which we
have not hitherto observed. In the place of
ploughs, they use an instrument of very hard
wood, shaped like a spade. This river is called
by the inhabitants of the country Choüacoet.</p>

<p>The next day Sieur de Monts and I landed
to observe their tillage on the bank of the river.
We saw their Indian corn, which they raise in
gardens. Planting three or four kernels in one
place, they then heap up about it a quantity of
earth with shells of the signoc before mentioned.
Then three feet distant they plant as
much more, and thus in succession. With this
corn they put in each hill three or four Brazilian
beans, which are of different colours. When
they grow up, they interlace with the corn,
which reaches to the height of from five to six
feet. They keep the ground very free from
weeds. We saw there many squashes, and pumpkins,
and tobacco, which they likewise cultivate.</p>

<p>The Indian corn which we saw was at that
time about two feet high, some of it as high
as three. The beans were beginning to flower,
as also the pumpkins and squashes. They plant
their corn in May, and gather it in September.</p>

<p>We saw also a great many white nuts, which
are small and have several divisions. There
were as yet none on the trees, but we found
plenty under them, from the preceding year.
We saw also many grape-vines, on which there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
was a remarkably fine berry, from which we
made some very good verjuice. We had heretofore
seen grapes only on the Island of Bacchus,
distant nearly two leagues from this river. Their
permanent abode, the tillage, and the fine trees
led us to conclude that the air here is milder
and better than that where we passed the winter,
and at the other places we visited on the
coast. But I cannot believe that there is not
here a considerable degree of cold, although
it is in latitude 43° 45′. The forests in the
interior are very thin, although abounding in
oaks, beeches, ashes, and elms; in wet places
there are many willows. The savages dwell permanently
in this place, and have a large cabin
surrounded by palisades made of rather large
trees placed by the side of each other, in which
they take refuge when their enemies make war
upon them. They cover their cabins with oak
bark. This place is very pleasant, and as agreeable
as any to be seen. The river is very abundant
in fish, and is bordered by meadows. At
the mouth there is a small island <span class="sidenote"><i>Ram Island</i></span>adapted for
the construction of a good fortress, where one
could be in security.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 12th of the month, we set
out from the river Choüacoet. After coasting
along some six or seven leagues, a contrary
wind arose, which obliged us to anchor and
go ashore, <span class="sidenote"><i>Wells Neck</i></span>where we saw two meadows, each a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
league in length and half a league in breadth.
We saw there two savages, whom at first we
took to be the great birds called bustards, to
be found in this country; who, as soon as they
caught sight of us, took flight into the woods,
and were not seen again. From Choüacoet to
this place, where we saw some little birds, which
sing like blackbirds, and are black excepting
the ends of the wings, which are orange-coloured,
there is a large number of grape-vines
and nut-trees. This coast is sandy, for the most
part, all the way from Quinibequy. This day
we returned two or three leagues towards Choüacoet,
as far as a cape which we called Island
Harbour, <span class="sidenote"><i>Cape Porpoise</i></span>favourable for vessels of a hundred
tons, about which are three islands. Heading
north-east a quarter north, one can enter another
harbour near this place, to which there is
no approach, although there are islands, except
the one where you enter. At the entrance there
are some dangerous reefs. There are in these
islands so many red currants that one sees for
the most part nothing else, and an infinite number
of pigeons, of which we took a great quantity.
This Island Harbour is in latitude 43° 25′.</p>

<p>On the 15th of the month we made twelve
leagues. Coasting along, we perceived a smoke
on the shore, which we approached as near as
possible, but saw no savage, which led us to
believe that they had fled. The sun set, and we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
could find no harbour for that night, since the
coast was flat and sandy. Keeping off, and heading
south, in order to find an anchorage, after
proceeding about two leagues, we observed a
cape on the main land south a quarter south-east
of us, some six leagues distant. <span class="sidenote"><i>Cape Anne</i></span>Two leagues to
the east we saw three or four rather high islands, <span class="sidenote"><i>Isles of Shoals</i></span>
and on the west a large bay. The shore of this
bay, reaching as far as the cape, extends inland
from where we were perhaps four leagues. It
has a breadth of two leagues from north to
south, and three at its entrance. Not observing
any place favourable for putting in, we resolved
to go to the cape above mentioned with short
sail, which occupied a portion of the night.
Approaching to where there were sixteen fathoms
of water, we anchored until daybreak.</p>

<p>On the next day we went to the above-mentioned
cape, where there are three islands near
the main land, full of wood of different kinds,
as at Choüacoet and all along the coast; and
still another flat one, where there are breakers,
and which extends a little farther out to sea
than the others, on which there is no wood at
all. We named this place Island Cape, near
which we saw a canoe containing five or six
savages, who came out near our barque, and
then went back and danced on the beach. Sieur
de Monts sent me on shore to observe them,
and to give each one of them a knife and some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
biscuit, which caused them to dance again better
than before. This over, I made them understand,
as well as I could, that I desired them
to show me the course of the shore. After I had
drawn with a crayon the bay, and the Island
Cape, where we were, with the same crayon
they drew the outline of another bay, which
they represented as very large; here they placed
six pebbles at equal distances apart, giving me
to understand by this that these signs represented
as many chiefs and tribes. Then they
drew within the first mentioned bay a river
which we had passed, <span class="sidenote"><i>Merrimac River</i></span>which has shoals and is
very long. We found in this place a great many
vines, the green grapes on which were a little
larger than peas, also many nut-trees, the nuts
on which were no larger than musket-balls.
The savages told us that all those inhabiting
this country cultivated the land and sowed seeds
like the others, whom we had before seen. The
latitude of this place is 43° and some minutes.
Sailing half a league farther, we observed several
savages on a rocky point, who ran along
the shore to their companions, dancing as they
went, to inform them of our coming. After
pointing out to us the direction of their abode,
they made a signal with smoke to show us the
place of their settlement. We anchored near a
little island, <span class="sidenote"><i>Thatcher’s Island</i></span>and sent our canoe with knives and
cakes for the savages. From the large number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
of those we saw, we concluded that these places
were better inhabited than the others we had
seen.</p>

<p>After a stay of some two hours for the sake of
observing these people, whose canoes are made
of birch bark, like those of the Canadians, Souriquois,
and Etechemins, we weighed anchor
and set sail with a promise of fine weather.
Continuing our course to the west-south-west,
we saw numerous islands on one side and the
other. Having sailed seven or eight leagues, we
anchored near an island, <span class="sidenote"><i>Boston Harbour</i></span>whence we observed
many smokes along the shore, and many savages
running up to see us. Sieur de Monts sent two
or three men in a canoe to them, to whom he
gave some knives and paternosters to present to
them; with which they were greatly pleased,
and danced several times in acknowledgment.
We could not ascertain the name of their chief,
as we did not know their language. All along
the shore there is a great deal of land cleared
up and planted with Indian corn. The country
is very pleasant and agreeable, and there is
no lack of fine trees. The canoes of those who
live there are made of a single piece, and are
very liable to turn over if one is not skilful in
managing them. We had not before seen any
of this kind. They are made in the following
manner. After cutting down, at a cost of much
labour and time, the largest and tallest tree they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
can find, by means of stone hatchets (for they
have no others except some few which they
received from the savages on the coasts of La
Cadie, who obtained them in exchange for furs),
they remove the bark, and round off the tree
except on one side, where they apply fire gradually
along its entire length; and sometimes
they put red-hot pebble-stones on top. When
the fire is too fierce, they extinguish it with a
little water, not entirely, but so that the edge
of the boat may not be burnt. It being hollowed
out as much as they wish, they scrape
it all over with stones, which they use instead
of knives. These stones resemble our musket
flints.</p>

<p>On the next day, the 17th of the month, we
weighed anchor to go to a cape we had seen the
day before, which seemed to lie on our south-south-west.
This day we were able to make
only five leagues, and we passed by some islands
covered with wood. I observed in the bay all
that the savages had described to me at Island
Cape. As we continued our course, large numbers
came to us in canoes from the islands and
main land. We anchored a league from a cape,
which we named St. Louis, <span class="sidenote"><i>Brant Rock Point</i></span>where we noticed
smoke in several places. While in the act of
going there, our barque grounded on a rock,
where we were in great danger, for, if we had
not speedily got it off, it would have overturned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
in the sea, since the tide was falling all
around, and there were five or six fathoms of
water. But God preserved us, and we anchored
near the above-named cape, when there came
to us fifteen or sixteen canoes of savages. In
some of them there were fifteen or sixteen, who
began to manifest great signs of joy, and made
various harangues, which we could not in the
least understand. Sieur de Monts sent three or
four men on shore in our canoe, not only to
get water, but to see their chief, whose name
was Honabetha. The latter had a number of
knives and other trifles, which Sieur de Monts
gave him, when he came alongside to see us,
together with some of his companions, who
were present both along the shore and in their
canoes. We received the chief very cordially,
and made him welcome; who, after remaining
some time, went back. Those whom we had
sent to them brought us some little squashes
as big as the fist, which we ate as a salad, like
cucumbers, and which we found very good.
They brought also some purslane, which grows
in large quantities among the Indian corn, and
of which they make no more account than of
weeds. We saw here a great many little houses,
scattered over the fields where they plant their
Indian corn.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, in this bay a very broad
river, which we named River du Guast. <span class="sidenote"><i>Charles River</i></span>It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
stretches, as it seemed to me, towards the Iroquois,
a nation in open warfare with the Montagnais,
who live on the great river St. Lawrence.</p>

<p class="negin1 fs120">Continuation of the Discoveries along
the Coast of the Almouchiquois, and
what we observed in detail.</p>


<p class="drop-cap">THE next day we doubled Cap St.
Louis, so named by Sieur de Monts,
a land rather low, and in latitude
42° 45′. The same day we sailed two leagues
along a sandy coast, as we passed along which
we saw a great many cabins and gardens. The
wind being contrary, we entered a little bay to
await a time favourable for proceeding. <span class="sidenote"><i>Plymouth Harbour</i></span>There
came to us two or three canoes, which had just
been fishing for cod and other fish, which are
found there in large numbers. These they catch
with hooks made of a piece of wood, to which
they attach a bone in the shape of a spear, and
fasten it very securely. The whole has a fang-shape,
and the line attached to it is made out
of the bark of a tree. They gave me one of
their hooks, which I took as a curiosity. In it
the bone was fastened on by hemp, like that in
France, as it seemed to me, and they told me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
that they gathered this plant without being
obliged to cultivate it; and indicated that it
grew to the height of four or five feet. This
canoe went back on shore to give notice to
their fellow inhabitants, who caused columns
of smoke to arise on our account. We saw
eighteen or twenty savages, who came to the
shore and began to dance. Our canoe landed
in order to give them some bagatelles, at which
they were greatly pleased. Some of them came
to us and begged us to go to their river. We
weighed anchor to do so, but were unable to
enter on account of the small amount of water,
it being low tide, and were accordingly obliged
to anchor at the mouth. I went ashore, where
I saw many others, who received us very cordially.
I made also an examination of the river,
but saw only an arm of water extending a short
distance inland, where the land is only in part
cleared up. Running into this is merely a brook
not deep enough for boats except at full tide.
The circuit of the bay is about a league. On
one side of the entrance to this bay there is a
point which is almost an island, covered with
wood, principally pines, with sand-banks, which
are very extensive, all about. On the other side,
the land is high. There are two islets in this
bay, which are not seen until one has entered,
and around which it is almost entirely dry at
low tide. This place is very conspicuous from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the sea, for the coast is very low, excepting the
cape at the entrance to the bay. We named it
the Port du Cap St. Louis, distant two leagues
from the above cape, and ten from the Island
Cape. It is in about the same latitude as Cap
St. Louis.</p>

<p>On the 19th of the month, we set out from
this place. Coasting along in a southerly direction,
we sailed four or five leagues, and passed
near a rock on a level with the surface of the
water. As we continued our course, we saw
some land which seemed to us to be islands,
but as we came nearer we found it to be the
main land, lying to the north-north-west of us,
and that it was the cape of a large bay, containing
more than eighteen or nineteen leagues in
circuit, into which we had run so far that we
had to wear off on the other tack in order to
double the cape which we had seen. <span class="sidenote"><i>Cape Cod</i></span>The latter
we named Cap Blanc, since it consisted of sands
and downs which had a white appearance. A
favourable wind was of great assistance to us
here, for otherwise we should have been in danger
of being driven upon the coast. This bay is
very safe, provided the land be not approached
nearer than a good league, there being no islands
nor rocks except that just mentioned, which is
near a river that extends some distance inland,
which we named St. Suzanne du Cap Blanc, <span class="sidenote"><i>Wellfleet Harbour</i></span>
whence across to Cap St. Louis the distance is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
ten leagues. Cap Blanc is a point of sand, which
bends around towards the south some six leagues.
This coast is rather high, and consists of sand,
which is very conspicuous as one comes from
the sea. At a distance of some fifteen or eighteen
leagues from land, the depth of the water
is thirty, forty, and fifty fathoms, but only ten
on nearing the shore, which is unobstructed.
There is a large extent of open country along
the shore before reaching the woods, which are
very attractive and beautiful. We anchored off
the coast, and saw some savages, towards whom
four of our company proceeded. Making their
way upon a sand-bank, they observed something
like a bay, and cabins bordering it on all sides.
When they were about a league and a half from
us, there came to them a savage dancing all over,
as they expressed it. He had come down from
the high shore, but turned about shortly after
to inform his fellow inhabitants of our arrival.</p>

<p>The next day, the 20th of the month, we
went to the place which our men had seen,
and which we found a very dangerous harbour <span class="sidenote"><i>Nauset Harbour</i></span>
in consequence of the shoals and banks, where
we saw breakers in all directions. It was almost
low tide when we entered, and there were only
four feet of water in the northern passage; at
high tide, there are two fathoms. After we had
entered, we found the place very spacious, being
perhaps three or four leagues in circuit, entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
surrounded by little houses, around each one
of which there was as much land as the occupant
needed for his support. A small river enters
here, which is very pretty, and in which at
low tide there are some three and a half feet
of water. There are also two or three brooks
bordered by meadows. It would be a very fine
place, if the harbour were good. I took the
altitude, and found the latitude 42°, and the deflection
of the magnetic needle 18° 40′. Many
savages, men and women, visited us, and ran
up on all sides dancing. We named this place
Port de Mallebarre.</p>

<p>The next day, the 21st of the month, Sieur
de Monts determined to go and see their habitations.
Nine or ten of us accompanied him
with our arms; the rest remained to guard the
barque. We went about a league along the
coast. Before reaching their cabins, we entered
a field planted with Indian corn in the manner
before described. The corn was in flower,
and five and a half feet high. There was some
less advanced, which they plant later. We saw
many Brazilian beans, and many squashes of various
sizes, very good for eating; some tobacco,
and roots which they cultivate, the latter having
the taste of an artichoke. The woods are filled
with oaks, nut-trees, and beautiful cypresses,
which are of a reddish colour and have a very
pleasant odour. There were also several fields<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
entirely uncultivated, the land being allowed
to remain fallow. When they wish to plant it,
they set fire to the weeds, and then work it over
with their wooden spades. Their cabins are
round, and covered with heavy thatch made of
reeds. In the roof there is an opening of about
a foot and a half, whence the smoke from the
fire passes out. We asked them if they had their
permanent abode in this place, and whether
there was much snow. But we were unable to
ascertain this fully from them, not understanding
their language, although they made an attempt
to inform us by signs, by taking some
sand in their hands, spreading it out over the
ground, and indicating that it was of the colour
of our collars, and that it reached the depth of
a foot. Others made signs that there was less,
and gave us to understand also that the harbour
never froze; but we were unable to ascertain
whether the snow lasted long. I conclude,
however, that this region is of moderate temperature,
and the winter not severe. While we
were there, there was a north-east storm, which
lasted four days; the sky being so overcast that
the sun hardly shone at all. It was very cold,
and we were obliged to put on our great-coats,
which we had entirely left off. Yet I think the
cold was accidental, as it is often experienced
elsewhere out of season.</p>

<p>On the 23d of July, four or five seamen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
having gone on shore with some kettles to get
fresh water, which was to be found in one of
the sand-banks a short distance from our barque,
some of the savages, coveting them, watched
the time when our men went to the spring, and
then seized one out of the hands of a sailor, who
was the first to dip, and who had no weapons.
One of his companions, starting to run after
him, soon returned, as he could not catch him,
since he ran much faster than himself. The
other savages, of whom there were a large number,
seeing our sailors running to our barque, and
at the same time shouting to us to fire at them,
took to flight. At the time there were some
of them in our barque, who threw themselves
into the sea, only one of whom we were able
to seize. Those on the land who had taken to
flight, seeing them swimming, returned straight
to the sailor from whom they had taken away
the kettle, hurled several arrows at him from
behind, and brought him down. Seeing this,
they ran at once to him, and despatched him
with their knives. Meanwhile, haste was made
to go on shore, and muskets were fired from
our barque: mine, bursting in my hands, came
near killing me. The savages, hearing this discharge
of fire-arms, took to flight, and with
redoubled speed when they saw that we had
landed, for they were afraid when they saw us
running after them. There was no likelihood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
of our catching them, for they are as swift as
horses. We brought in the murdered man, and
he was buried some hours later. Meanwhile,
we kept the prisoner bound by the feet and
hands on board of our barque, fearing that he
might escape. But Sieur de Monts resolved to
let him go, being persuaded that he was not to
blame, and that he had no previous knowledge
of what had transpired, as also those who, at the
time, were in and about our barque. Some hours
later there came some savages to us, to excuse
themselves, indicating by signs and demonstrations
that it was not they who had committed
this malicious act, but others farther off in the
interior. We did not wish to harm them, although
it was in our power to avenge ourselves.</p>

<p>All these savages from the Island Cape wear
neither robes nor furs, except very rarely: moreover,
their robes are made of grasses and hemp,
scarcely covering the body, and coming down
only to their thighs. They have only the private
parts concealed with a small piece of leather; so
likewise the women, with whom it comes down
a little lower behind than with the men, all the
rest of the body being naked. Whenever the
women came to see us, they wore robes which
were open in front. The men cut off the hair
on the top of the head like those at the river
Choüacoet. I saw, among other things, a girl
with her hair very neatly dressed, with a skin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
coloured red, and bordered on the upper part
with little shell-beads. A part of her hair hung
down behind, the rest being braided in various
ways. These people paint the face red, black,
and yellow. They have scarcely any beard, and
tear it out as fast as it grows. Their bodies
are well-proportioned. I cannot tell what government
they have, but I think that in this
respect they resemble their neighbours, who
have none at all. They know not how to worship
or pray; yet, like the other savages, they
have some superstitions, which I shall describe
in their place. As for weapons, they have only
pikes, clubs, bows and arrows. It would seem
from their appearance that they have a good
disposition, better than those of the north, but
they are all in fact of no great worth. Even a
slight intercourse with them gives you at once
a knowledge of them. They are great thieves
and, if they cannot lay hold of any thing with
their hands, they try to do so with their feet,
as we have oftentimes learned by experience.
I am of opinion that, if they had any thing to
exchange with us, they would not give themselves
to thieving. They bartered away to us
their bows, arrows and quivers, for pins and
buttons; and if they had had any thing else
better they would have done the same with it.
It is necessary to be on one’s guard against this
people, and live in a state of distrust of them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
yet without letting them perceive it. They gave
us a large quantity of tobacco, which they dry
and then reduce to powder. When they eat
Indian corn, they boil it in earthen pots, which
they make in a way different from ours. They
pound it also in wooden mortars and reduce it
to flour, of which they then make cakes, like
the Indians of Peru.</p>

<p>In this place and along the whole coast from
Quinibequy, there are a great many <em>siguenocs</em>, <span class="sidenote"><i>Horseshoe Crab</i></span>
which is a fish with a shell on its back like
the tortoise, yet different, there being in the
middle a row of little prickles, of the colour of
a dead leaf, like the rest of the fish. At the
end of this shell, there is another still smaller,
bordered by very sharp points. The length of
the tail varies according to their size. With
the end of it, these people point their arrows,
and it contains also a row of prickles like the
large shell in which are the eyes. There are
eight small feet like those of the crab, and two
behind longer and flatter, which they use in
swimming. There are also in front two other
very small ones with which they eat. When
walking, all the feet are concealed excepting
the two hindermost, which are slightly visible.
Under the small shell there are membranes
which swell up, and beat like the throat of a
frog, and rest upon each other like the folds of
a waistcoat. The largest specimen of this fish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
that I saw was a foot broad, and a foot and a
half long.</p>

<p>We saw also a sea-bird with a black beak,
the upper part slightly aquiline, four inches long
and in the form of a lancet; namely, the lower
part representing the handle and the upper the
blade, which is thin, sharp on both sides, and
shorter by a third than the other, which circumstance
is a matter of astonishment to many
persons, who cannot comprehend how it is possible
for this bird to eat with such a beak. It
is of the size of a pigeon, the wings being very
long in proportion to the body, the tail short,
as also the legs, which are red; the feet being
small and flat. The plumage on the upper part is
gray-brown, and on the under part pure white.
They go always in flocks along the sea-shore,
like the pigeons with us.</p>

<p>The savages, along all these coasts where
we have been, say that other birds, which are
very large, come along when their corn is ripe.
They imitated for us their cry, which resembles
that of the turkey. They showed us their feathers
in several places, with which they feather
their arrows, and which they put on their heads
for decoration; and also a kind of hair which
they have under the throat like those we have
in France, and they say that a red crest falls over
upon the beak. According to their description,
they are as large as a bustard, which is a kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
of goose, having the neck longer and twice as
large as those with us. All these indications
led us to conclude that they were turkeys. We
should have been very glad to see some of these
birds, as well as their feathers, for the sake of
greater certainty. Before seeing their feathers,
and the little bunch of hair which they have
under the throat, and hearing their cry imitated,
I should have thought that they were
certain birds like turkeys, which are found in
some places in Peru, along the sea-shore, eating
carrion and other dead things like crows.
But these are not so large; nor do they have so
long a wattle, or a cry like that of real turkeys;
nor are they good to eat like those which the
Indians say come in flocks in summer, and at
the beginning of winter go away to warmer
countries, their natural dwelling-place.</p>

<p class="negin1 fs120">Return from the Discoveries along the
Coast of the Almouchiquois.</p>


<p class="drop-cap">WE had spent more than five weeks in
going over three degrees of latitude,
and our voyage was limited to six,
since we had not taken provisions for a longer
time. In consequence of fogs and storms, we
had not been able to go farther than Mallebarre,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
where we waited several days for fair weather,
in order to sail. Finding ourselves accordingly
pressed by the scantiness of provisions, Sieur de
Monts determined to return to the Island of
St. Croix, in order to find another place more
favourable for our settlement, as we had not
been able to do on any of the coasts which we
had explored on this voyage.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the 25th of July, we set
out from this harbour, in order to make observations
elsewhere. In going out, we came near
being lost on the bar at the entrance, from the
mistake of our pilots, Cramolet and Champdoré,
masters of the barque, who had imperfectly
marked out the entrance of the channel
on the southern side, where we were to go.
Having escaped this danger, we headed north-east
for six leagues, until we reached Cap Blanc,
sailing on from there to Island Cape, a distance
of fifteen leagues, with the same wind. Then
we headed east-north-east sixteen leagues, as far
as Choüacoet, where we saw the savage chief,
Marchin, whom we had expected to see at the
Lake Quinibequy. He had the reputation of
being one of the valiant ones of his people. He
had a fine appearance: all his motions were
dignified, savage as he was. Sieur de Monts
gave him many presents, with which he was
greatly pleased; and, in return, Marchin gave
him a young Etechemin boy, whom he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
captured in war, and whom we took away with
us; and thus we set out, mutually good friends.
We headed north-east a quarter east for fifteen
leagues, as far as Quinibequy, where we arrived
on the 29th of the month, and where we
were expecting to find a savage, named Sasinou,
of whom I spoke before. Thinking that he
would come, we waited some time for him,
in order to recover from him an Etechemin
young man and girl, whom he was holding as
prisoners. While waiting, there came to us a
captain called Anassou, who trafficked a little in
furs, and with whom we made an alliance. <span class="sidenote"><i>Waymouth in the Archangel</i></span>He
told us that there was a ship, ten leagues off
the harbour, which was engaged in fishing, and
that those on her had killed five savages of this
river, under cover of friendship. From his description
of the men on the vessel, we concluded
that they were English, and we named the Island
where they were La Nef; <span class="sidenote"><i>Monhegan</i></span>for, at a distance,
it had the appearance of a ship. Finding that
the above-mentioned Sasinou did not come, we
headed east-south-east, for twenty leagues, to
Isle Haute, where we anchored until morning.</p>

<p>On the next day, the 1st of August, <span class="sidenote"><i>August</i></span>we sailed
east some twenty leagues to Cap Corneille,
where we spent the night. <span class="sidenote"><i>Machias Bay</i></span>On the 2d of the
month, we sailed north-east seven leagues to
the mouth of the river St. Croix, on the western
shore. Having anchored between the two first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
islands, <span class="sidenote"><i>Campobello and Eastport</i></span>Sieur de Monts embarked in a canoe,
at a distance of six leagues from the settlement
of St. Croix, where we arrived the next day
with our barque. We found there Sieur des
Antons of St. Malo, who had come in one of
the vessels of Sieur de Monts, to bring provisions
and also other supplies for those who were to
winter in this country.</p>

A TRUE RELATION

<p class="drop-cap">VPON Tuesday the 5 day of March, <span class="sidenote"><i>1605 March</i></span>
about ten a clocke afore noone, we
set saile from Ratcliffe, and came to
an anker that tide about two a clocke before
Grauesend.</p>

<p>From thence the 10 of March being Sunday
at night we ankered in the Downes: and there
rode til the next day about three a clocke after
noone, when with a scant winde we set saile; and
by reason the winde continued Southwardly,
we were beaten vp and doune: but on Saturday
the 16 day about foure a clocke after noon
we put into Dartmouth Hauen, where the continuance
of the winde at South &amp; Southwest
constrained vs to ride till the last of this moneth.
There we shipped some of our men and supplied
necessaries for our Ship and Voyage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>Upon Easter day, being the last of March, the
winde comming at North-North-East, about
fiue a clocke after noone we wayed anker, and
put to sea. In the name of God, being well
victualled and furnished with munition and all
necessaries: Our whole Company being but 29
persons; of whom I may boldly say, few voyages
have beene manned forth with better Sea-men
generally in respect of our small number.</p>

<p>Munday the next day, being the first of Aprill, <span class="sidenote"><i>April</i></span>
by sixe a clocke in the morning we were sixe
leagues South-South-East from the Lizarde.</p>

<p>At two a clocke in the afternoone this day,
the weather being very faire, our Captaine for
his owne experience and others with him sounded,
and had sixe and fiftie fathoms and a halfe.
The sounding was some small blacke perrie
sand, some reddish sand, a match or two, with
small shels called Saint James his Shels.</p>

<p>The foureteenth of Aprill being Sunday, betweene
nine and ten of the clocke in the morning
our Captaine descried the Iland Cueruo:
which bare South-West and by West, about
seuen leagues from vs: by eleuen of the clocke
we descried Flores to the Southward of Cueruo,
as it lieth: by foure a clocke in the afternoone
we brought Cueruo due South from vs within
two leagues of the shore, but we touched not,
because the winde was faire, and we thought
our selues sufficiently watered and wooded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>Heere our Captaine obserued the Sunne, and
found himselfe in the latitude of 40 degrees
and 7 minutes: so he judged the North part
of Cueruo to be in 40 degrees. After we had
kept our course about a hundred leagues from
the Ilands, by continuall Southerly windes we
were forced and driuen from the Southward,
whither we first intended. And when our Captaine
by long beating saw it was but in vaine to
striue with windes, not knowing Gods purposes
heerein to our further blessing, (which after by
his especiall direction wee found) he thought
best to stand as nigh as he could by the winde
to recouer what land we might first discouer.</p>

<p>Munday, the 6 of May, <span class="sidenote"><i>May</i></span>being in the latitude
of 39 and a halfe about ten a clocke afore
noone, we came to a riplin, which we discerned
a head our ship, which is a breach of water
caused either by a fall, or by some meeting of
currents, which we judged this to be; for the
weather being very faire, and a small gale of
winde, we sounded and found no ground in a
hundred fathoms.</p>

<p>Munday, the 13 of May, about eleuen a
clocke afore noone, our Captaine, judging we
were not farre from land, sounded, and had a
soft oaze in a hundred and sixty fathomes. At
fowre a clocke after noone we sounded againe,
and had the same oaze in a hundred fathoms.</p>

<p>From ten a clocke that night till three a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
clocke in the morning, our Captaine tooke in
all sailes and lay at hull, being desirous to fall
with the land in the day time, because it was an
unknowen coast, which it pleased God in his
mercy to grant vs, otherwise we had run our
ship vpon the hidden rockes and perished all.
For when we set saile we sounded in 100 fathoms:
and by eight a clock, hauing not made
aboue fiue or six leagues, our Captaine vpon a
sudden change of water (supposing verily he saw
the sand) presently sounded, and had but fiue
fathoms. Much maruelling because we saw
no land, he sent one to the top, who thence descried
a whitish sandy cliffe, <span class="sidenote"><i>Sankaty Head</i></span>which bare West-North-West
about six leagues off from vs: but
comming neerer within three or fowre leagues,
we saw many breaches still neerer the land: at
last we espied a great breach a head vs al along
the shore, into which before we should enter,
our Captaine thought best to hoise out his ship
boate and sound it. Which if he had not done,
we had beene in great danger: for he bare vp
the ship, as neere as he durst after the boate:
vntill Thomas Cam, his mate, being in the boat,
called to him to tacke about &amp; stand off, for
in this breach he had very showld water, two
fathoms and lesse vpon rockes, and sometime
they supposed they saw the rocke within three
or fowre foote, whereon the sea made a very
strong breach: which we might discerne (from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
the top) to run along as we sailed by it 6 or
7 leagues to the Southward. This was in the
latitude of 41 degrees, 20 minuts: wherefore
we were constrained to put backe againe from
the land: and sounding, (the weather being
very faire and a small winde) we found our selues
embaied with continuall showldes and rockes
in a most uncertaine ground, from five or sixe
fathoms, at the next cast of the lead we should
haue 15 &amp; 18 fathoms. Ouer many which we
passed, and God so blessed vs, that we had wind
and weather as faire as poore men in this distresse
could wish: whereby we both perfectly
discerned euery breach, and with the winde
were able to turne, where we saw most hope of
safest passage. Thus we parted from the land,
which we had not so much before desired, and
at the first sight rejoiced, as now we all joifully
praised God, that it had pleased him to deliuer
vs from so imminent danger.</p>

<p>Heere we found great store of excellent Cod
fish, and saw many Whales, as we had done two
or three daies before.</p>

<p>We stood off all that night, and the next day
being Wednesday; but the wind still continuing
between the points of South-South-West,
and West-South-West: so as we could not
make any way to the Southward, in regard of
our great want of water and wood (which was
now spent) we much desired land and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
sought for it, where the wind would best suffer
vs to refresh our selues.</p>

<p>Thursday, the 16 of May, we stood in directly
with the land, and much maruelled we
descried it not, wherein we found our sea charts
very false, putting land where none is.</p>

<p>Friday, the 17 of May, about sixe a clocke at
night we descried the land, which bare from vs
North-North-East; but because it blew a great
gale of winde, the sea very high and neere night,
not fit to come vpon an vnknowen coast, we
stood off till two a clocke in the morning, being
Saturday: then standing in with it againe,
we descried it by eight a clocke in the morning,
bearing North-East from vs. It appeared
a meane high land, as we after found it, <span class="sidenote"><i>Monhegan</i></span>being
but an Iland of some six miles in compasse, but
I hope the most fortunate euer yet discouered.
About twelve a clocke that day, we came to
an anker on the North side of this Iland, about
a league from the shore. About two a clocke
our Captaine with twelue men rowed in his ship
boat to the shore, where we made no long stay,
but laded our boat with dry wood of olde trees
vpon the shore side, and returned to our ship,
where we rode that night.</p>

<p>This Iland is woody, growen with Firre,
Birch, Oke and Beech, as farre as we saw along
the shore; and so likely to be within. On the
verge grow Gooseberries, Strawberries, Wild<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
pease, and Wild rose bushes. The water issued
foorth downe the Rocky cliffes in many places:
and much fowle of diuers kinds breed vpon the
shore and rocks.</p>

<p>While we were at shore, our men aboord
with a few hooks got aboue thirty great Cods
and Hadocks, which gaue vs a taste of the
great plenty of fish which we found afterward
wheresoeuer we went vpon the coast.</p>

<p>From hence we might discerne the maine
land from the West-South-West to the East-North-East,
and a great way (as it then seemed,
and as we after found it) vp into the maine we
might discerne very high mountaines, <span class="sidenote"><i>Camden Hills</i></span>though
the maine seemed but low land; which gaue
vs a hope it would please God to direct vs to
the discouerie of some good; although wee
were driuen by winds farre from that place,
whither (both by our direction and desire) we
euer intended to shape the course of our voyage.</p>

<p>The next day being Whit-Sunday; because
we rode too much open to the sea and windes,
we weyed anker about twelue a clocke, and
came along to the other Ilands more adjoyning
to the maine, and in the rode directly with the
mountaines, about three leagues from the first
Iland where we had ankered.</p>

<p>When we came neere vnto them (sounding
all along in a good depth) our Captaine manned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
his ship-boat and sent her before with Thomas
Cam one of his Mates, whom he knew to be of
good experience, to sound &amp; search betweene
the Ilands for a place safe for our shippe to
ride in; <span class="sidenote"><i>St. George’s Islands</i></span>in the meane while we kept aloofe at
sea, hauing giuen them in the boat a token
to weffe in the ship, if he found a conuenient
Harbour; which it pleased God to send vs, farre
beyond our expectation, in a most safe birth
defended from all windes, in an excellent depth
of water for ships of any burthen, in six, seuen,
eight, nine and ten fathoms vpon a clay oaze
very tough.</p>

<p>We all with great joy praised God for his
vnspeakable goodnesse, who had from so apparent
danger deliuered vs, &amp; directed vs vpon
this day into so secure an Harbour: in remembrance
whereof we named it Pentecost harbor,
we arriuing there that day out of our last
Harbor in England, from whence we set saile
vpon Easterday.</p>

<p>About foure a clocke, after we were ankered
and well mored, our Captaine with halfe a
dozen of our Company went on shore to seeke
fresh watering, and a conuenient place to set together
a pinnesse, which we brought in pieces
out of England; both which we found very fitting.</p>

<p>Vpon this Iland, as also vpon the former, we
found (at our first comming to shore) where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
fire had beene made: and about the place were
very great egge shelles bigger than goose egges,
fish bones, and as we judged, the bones of some
beast.</p>

<p>Here we espied Cranes stalking on the shore
of a little Iland adjoyning; where we after saw
they vsed to breed.</p>

<p>Whitsun-munday, the 20 day of May, very
early in the morning, our Captaine caused the
pieces of the pinnesse to be carried a shore,
where while some were busied about her, others
digged welles to receiue the fresh water,
which we found issuing downe out of the land
in many places. Heere I cannot omit (for foolish
feare of imputation of flattery) the painfull
industry of our Captaine, who as at sea he is
alwayes most carefull and vigilant, so at land
he refuseth no paines; but his labour was euer
as much or rather more than any mans: which
not only encourageth others with better content,
but also effecteth much with great expedition.</p>

<p>In digging we found excellent clay for bricke
or tile.</p>

<p>The next day we finished a well of good and
holesome cleere water in a great empty caske,
which we left there. We cut yards, waste trees,
and many necessaries for our ship, while our
Carpenter and Cooper laboured to fit and furnish
forth the shallop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>This day our boat went out about a mile
from our ship, and in small time with two
or three hooks was fished sufficiently for our
whole Company three dayes, with great Cod,
Haddocke, and Thornebacke.</p>

<p>And towards night we drew with a small
net of twenty fathoms very nigh the shore: we
got about thirty very good and great Lobsters,
many Rockfish, some Plaise, and other small
fishes, and fishes called Lumpes, verie pleasant
to the taste: and we generally obserued, that all
the fish, of what kinde soeuer we tooke, were
well fed, fat, and sweet in taste.</p>

<p>Wednesday, the 22 of May, we felled and
cut wood for our ships vse, cleansed and scoured
our wels, and digged a plot of ground, wherein,
amongst some garden seeds, we sowed peaze
and barley, which in sixteen dayes grew eight
inches aboue ground; and so continued growing
euery day halfe an inch, although this
was but the crust of the ground, and much
inferior to the mould we after found in the
maine.</p>

<p>Friday, the 24 of May, after we had made an
end of cutting wood, and carying water aboord
our shippe, with fourteene Shot and Pikes we
marched about and thorow part of two of the
Ilands; the bigger of which we judged to be
foure or fiue miles in compasse, and a mile
broad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>The profits and fruits which are naturally on
these Ilands are these:</p>

<p class="noindent">out of which issueth Turpentine in so maruellous plenty, and
so sweet, as our Chirurgeon and others affirmed
they neuer saw so good in England. We pulled
off much Gumme congealed on the outside of
the barke, which smelled like Frankincense.
This would be a great benefit for making Tarre
and Pitch.</p>

<p>We stayed the longer in this place, not only
because of our good Harbour (which is an excellent
comfort) but because euery day we did
more and more discouer the pleasant fruitfulnesse;
insomuch as many of our Companie
wished themselues setled heere, not expecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
any further hopes, or better discouery to be
made.</p>

<p>Heere our men found abundance of great
muscels among the rocks; and in some of them
many small Pearls: and in one muscell (which
we drew vp in our net) was found foureteene
Pearles, whereof one of prety bignesse and orient;
in another aboue fiftie small Pearles; and
if we had had a Drag, no doubt we had found
some of great valew, seeing these did certainly
shew, that heere they were bred: the shels all
glistering with mother of Pearle.</p>

<p>Wednesday, the 29 day, our shallop being
now finished, and our Captaine and men furnished
to depart with hir from the ship: we
set vp a crosse on the shore side vpon the rockes.</p>

<p>Thursday, the 30 of May, about ten a clock
afore noon, our Captaine with 13 men more,
in the name of God, and with all our praiers
for their prosperous discouerie, and safe returne,
departed in the shallop: leauing the ship in a
good harbour, which before I mentioned, well
mored, and manned with 14 men.</p>

<p>This day, about fiue a clocke in the afternoone,
we in the shippe espied three Canoas
comming towards vs, which went to the iland
adjoining, where they went a shore, and very
quickly had made a fire, about which they stood
beholding our ship: to whom we made signes
with our hands and hats, weffing vnto them to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
come vnto vs, because we had not seene any of
the people yet. They sent one Canoa with three
men, one of which, when they came neere vnto
vs, spake in his language very lowd and very
boldly: seeming as though he would know why
we were there, and by pointing with his oare
towards the sea, we conjectured he ment we
should be gone. But when we shewed them
kniues and their vse, by cutting of stickes and
other trifles, as combs and glasses, they came
close aboard our ship, as desirous to entertaine
our friendship. To these we gaue such things
as we perceiued they liked, when wee shewed
them the vse: bracelets, rings, peacocke feathers,
which they stucke in their haire, and Tabacco
pipes. After their departure to their
company on the shore, presently came foure
other in another Canoa: to whom we gaue as
to the former, vsing them with as much kindnes
as we could.</p>

<p>The shape of their body is very proportionable,
they are wel countenanced, not very tal nor
big, but in stature like to vs: they paint their
bodies with blacke, their faces, some with red,
some with blacke, and some with blew.</p>

<p>Their clothing is Beauers skins, or Deares
skins, cast ouer them like a mantle, and hanging
downe to their knees, made fast together vpon
the shoulder with leather; some of them had
sleeues, most had none; some had buskins of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
such leather tewed: they haue besides a peece
of Beauers skin betweene their legs, made fast
about their waste, to couer their priuities.</p>

<p>They suffer no haire to grow on their faces,
but on their head very long and very blacke,
which those that haue wiues, binde vp behinde
with a leather string, in a long round knot.</p>

<p>They seemed all very ciuill and merrie:
shewing tokens of much thankefulnesse, for
those things we gaue them. We found them
then (as after) a people of exceeding good inuention,
quicke vnderstanding and readie capacitie.</p>

<p>Their Canoas are made without any iron, of
the bark of a birch tree, strengthened within
with ribs and hoops of wood, in so good fashion,
with such excellent ingenious art, as they
are able to beare seuen or eight persons, far
exceeding any in the Indies.</p>

<p>One of their Canoas came not to vs, wherein
we imagined their women were: of whom
they are (as all Saluages) very jealous.</p>

<p>When I signed unto them they should goe
sleepe, because it was night, they vnderstood
presently, and pointed that at the shore, right
against our ship, they would stay all night: as
they did.</p>

<p>The next morning very early, came one Canoa
abord vs againe with three Saluages, whom
we easily then enticed into our ship, and vnder
the decke: where we gaue them porke, fish,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
bread and pease, all which they did eat; and
this I noted, they would eat nothing raw, either
fish or flesh. They maruelled much and much
looked vpon the making of our canne and kettle,
so they did at a head-peece and at our guns, of
which they are most fearefull, and would fall
flat downe at the report of them. At their departure
I signed vnto them, that if they would
bring me such skins as they ware I would giue
them kniues, and such things as I saw they most
liked, which the chiefe of them promised to do
by that time the Sunne should be beyond the
middest of the firmament; this I did to bring
them to an vnderstanding of exchange, and that
they might conceiue the intent of our comming
to them to be for no other end.</p>

<p>About 10 a clocke this day we descried our
Shallop returning toward vs, which so soone
as we espied, we certainly conjectured our Captaine
had found some vnexpected harbour, further
vp towards the maine to bring the ship into,
or some riuer; knowing his determination and
resolution, not so suddenly else to make return:
which when they came neerer they expressed
by shooting volleies of shot; and when they
were come within Musket shot, they gaue vs a
volley and haled vs, then we in the shippe gaue
them a great peece and haled them.</p>

<p>Thus we welcomed them; who gladded vs
exceedingly with their joifull relation of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
happie discouerie, which shall appeare in the
sequele. And we likewise gaue them cause of
mutuall joy with vs, in discoursing of the kinde
ciuility we found in a people, where we little
expected any sparke of humanity.</p>

<p>Our Captaine had in this small time discouered
vp a great riuer, <span class="sidenote"><i>St. George’s River</i></span>trending alongst into the
maine about forty miles. The pleasantnesse
whereof, with the safety of harbour for shipping,
together with the fertility of ground and
other fruits, which were generally by his whole
company related, I omit, till I report of the
whole discouery therein after performed. For
by the breadth, depth and strong flood, imagining
it to run far vp into the land, he with speed
returned, intending to flanke his light horsman
for arrowes, least it might happen that the further
part of the riuer should be narrow, and by
that meanes subject to the volley of Saluages on
either side out of the woods.</p>

<p>Vntill his returne, our Captaine left on shore
where he landed in a path (which seemed to
be frequented) a pipe, a brooch and a knife,
thereby to know if the Saluages had recourse
that way, because they could at that time see
none of them, but they were taken away before
our returne thither.</p>

<p>I returne now to our Saluages, who according
to their appointment about one a clocke,
came with 4 Canoas to the shoare of the iland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
right ouer against vs, where they had lodged
the last night, and sent one Canoa to vs with
two of those Saluages, who had beene a bord,
and another, who then seemed to haue command
of them; for though we perceiued their
willingnesse, yet he would not permit them
to come abord; but he hauing viewed vs and
our ship, signed that he would go to the rest
of the company and returne againe. Presently
after their departure it began to raine, and continued
all that afternoone, so as they could not
come to vs with their skins and furs, nor we
go to them. But after an howre or there about,
the three which had beene with vs before came
againe, whom we had to our fire and couered
them with our gownes. Our Captaine bestowed
a shirt vpon him, whom we thought to be their
chiefe, who seemed neuer to haue seene any
before; we gaue him a brooch to hang about
his necke, a great knife, and lesser kniues to the
two other, and to euery one of them a combe
and glasse, the vse whereof we shewed them:
whereat they laughed and tooke gladly; we
victualled them, and gaue them aqua vitae,
which they tasted, but would by no meanes
drinke; our beueridge they liked well, we gaue
them Sugar Candy, which after they had tasted
they liked and desired more, and raisons which
were giuen them; and some of euery thing they
would reserue to carry to their company. Wherefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
we pittying their being in the raine, and
therefore not able to get themselues victuall (as
we thought) we gaue them bread and fish.</p>

<p>Thus because we found the land a place answereable
to the intent of our discouery, viz. fit
for any nation to inhabit, we vsed the people
with as great kindnes as we could deuise, or
found them capable of.</p>

<p>The next day, being Saturday and the first
of June, <span class="sidenote"><i>June</i></span>I traded with the Saluages all the
fore noone vpon the shore, where were eight
and twenty of them: and because our ship rode
nigh, we were but fiue or sixe: where for kniues,
glasses, combes and other trifles to the valew of
foure or fiue shillings, we had 40 good Beauers
skins, Otters skins, Sables, and other small skins,
which we knewe not how to call. Our trade
being ended, many of them came abord vs,
and did eat by our fire, and would be verie
merrie and bold, in regard of our kinde vsage
of them. Towards night our Captaine went on
shore, to haue a draught with the Sein or Net.
And we carried two of them with vs, who
maruelled to see vs catch fish with a net. Most
of that we caught we gaue them and their company.
Then on the shore I learned the names
of diuers things of them: and when they perceiued
me to note them downe, they would of
themselues, fetch fishes, and fruit bushes, and
stand by me to see me write their names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>Our Captaine shewed them a strange thing
which they woondred at. His sword and mine
hauing beene touched with the Loadstone, tooke
vp a knife, and held it fast when they plucked
it away, made the knife turne, being laid on a
blocke, and touching it with his sword, made
that take vp a needle, whereat they much maruelled.
This we did to cause them to imagine
some great power in vs: and for that to loue
and feare vs.</p>

<p>When we went on shore to trade with them,
in one of their Canoas I saw their bowes and
arrowes, which I tooke vp and drew an arrow
in one of them, which I found to be of strength
able to carry an arrow fiue or sixe score stronglie;
and one of them tooke it and drew as we
draw our bowes, not like the Indians. Their bow
is made of Wich Hazell, and some of Beech
in fashion much like our bowes, but they want
nocks, onely a string of leather put through a
hole at one end, and made fast with a knot at
the other. Their arrowes are made of the same
wood, some of Ash, big and long, with three
feathers tied on, and nocked very artificiallie:
headed with the long shanke bone of a Deere,
made very sharpe with two fangs in manner of
a harping iron. They haue likewise Darts,
headed with like bone, one of which I darted
among the rockes, and it brake not. These they
vse very cunningly, to kill fish, fowle and beasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>Our Captaine had two of them at supper
with vs in his cabbin to see their demeanure,
and had them in presence at seruice: who behaued
themselues very ciuilly, neither laughing
nor talking all the time, and at supper fed not
like men of rude education, neither would they
eat or drinke more than seemed to content
nature; they desired pease to carry a shore to
their women, which we gaue them, with fish
and bread, and lent them pewter dishes, which
they carefully brought againe.</p>

<p>In the evening another boat came to them
on the shore, and because they had some Tabacco,
which they brought for their owne vse,
the other came for vs, making signe what they
had, and offered to carry some of vs in their
boat, but foure or fiue of vs went with them in
our owne boat: when we came on shore they
gaue vs the best welcome they could, spreading
fallow Deeres skins for vs to sit on the ground
by their fire, and gaue vs of their Tabacco in
our pipes, which was excellent, and so generally
commended of vs all to be as good as any we
euer tooke, being the simple leafe without any
composition, strong, and of sweet taste; they
gaue us some to carry to our Captaine, whom
they called our Bashabes; neither did they require
any thing for it, but we would not receiue
any thing from them without remuneration.</p>

<p>Heere we saw foure of their women, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
stood behind them, as desirous to see vs, but
not willing to be seene; for before, whensoeuer
we came on shore, they retired into the woods,
whether it were in regard of their owne naturall
modestie, being couered only as the men
with the foresaid Beauers skins, or by the commanding
jealousy of their husbands, which we
rather suspected, because it is an inclination
much noted to be in Saluages; wherfore we
would by no meanes seeme to take any speciall
notice of them. They were very well fauoured
in proportion of countenance, though coloured
blacke, low of stature, and fat, bare headed as
the men, wearing their haire long: they had
two little male children of a yeere and half
old, as we judged, very fat and of good countenances,
which they loue tenderly, all naked,
except their legs, which were couered with
thin leather buskins tewed, fastened with strops
to a girdle about their waste, which they girde
very streight, and is decked round about with
little round peeces of red Copper; to these I
gaue chaines and bracelets, glasses, and other
trifles, which the Saluages seemed to accept in
great kindnesse.</p>

<p>At our comming away, we would haue had
those two that supped with vs, to go abord and
sleepe, as they had promised; but it appeared
their company would not suffer them. Whereat
we might easily perceiue they were much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
greeued; but not long after our departure, they
came with three more to our ship, signing to
vs, that if one of our company would go lie on
shore with them, they would stay with vs. Then
Owen Griffin (one of the two we were to leaue
in the Country, if we had thought it needfull or
conuenient) went with them in their Canoa, and
3 of them staied aborde vs, whom our whole
company very kindly vsed. Our Captaine saw
their lodging prouided, and them lodged in an
old saile vpon the Orlop; and because they much
feared our dogs, they were tied vp whensoeuer
any of them came abord vs.</p>

<p>Owen Griffin, which lay on the shore, reported
vnto me their maner, and (as I may terme
them) the ceremonies of their idolatry; which
they performe thus. One among them (the eldest
of the Company, as he judged) riseth right
vp, the other sitting still, and looking about, suddenly
cried with a loud voice, Baugh, Waugh: <span class="sidenote"><i>Powwow</i></span>
then the women fall downe, and lie vpon the
ground, and the men all together answering the
same, fall a stamping round about the fire with
both feet, as hard as they can, making the ground
shake, with sundry out-cries, and change of voice
and sound. Many take the fire-sticks and thrust
them into the earth, and then rest awhile: of
a sudden beginning as before, they continue so
stamping, till the yonger sort fetched from the
shore many stones, of which euery man tooke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
one, and first beat vpon them with their fire-sticks,
then with the stones beat the earth with
all their strength. And in this maner (as he
reported) they continued aboue two houres.</p>

<p>After this ended, they which haue wiues take
them apart, and withdraw themselues seuerally
into the wood all night.</p>

<p>The next morning, <ins class="corr" id="tn-123" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'assoone as they'">
as soone as they</ins> saw the
Sunne rise, they pointed to him to come with
them to our shippe: and hauing receiued their
men from vs, they came with fiue or sixe of
their Canoas and Company houering about our
ship; to whom (because it was the Sabbath day)
I signed they should depart, and at the next Sun
rising we would goe along with them to their
houses; which they vnderstood (as we thought)
and departed, some of their Canoas coursing
about the Iland, and the other directly towards
the maine.</p>

<p>This day, about fiue a clocke after noone,
came three other Canoas from the maine, of
which some had beene with vs before; and they
came aboord vs, and brought vs Tabacco, which
we tooke with them in their pipes, which were
made of earth, very strong, blacke, and short
containing a great quantity: some Tabacco they
gaue vnto our Captaine, and some to me, in very
ciuill kind maner. We requited them with bread
and peaze, which they caried to their Company
on shore, seeming very thankefull. After supper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
they returned with their Canoa to fetch vs a
shore to take Tabacco with them there: with
whom six or seuen of vs went, and caried some
trifles, if peradventure they had any trucke,
among which I caried some few biskets, to try
if they would exchange for them, seeing they so
well liked to eat them. When we came at shore,
they most kindly entertained vs, taking vs by
the hands, as they had obserued we did to them
aboord, in token of welcome, and brought vs to
sit downe by their fire, where sat together thirteene
of them. They filled their Tabacco pipe,
which was then the short claw of a Lobster,
which will hold ten of our pipes full, and we
dranke of their excellent Tabacco as much as
we would with them; but we saw not any great
quantity to trucke for; and it seemed they had
not much left of old, for they spend a great quantity
yeerely by their continuall drinking: and
they would signe vnto vs, that it was growen yet
but a foot aboue ground, and would be aboue
a yard high, with a leafe as broad as both their
hands. They often would (by pointing to one
part of the maine Eastward) signe vnto vs, that
their Bashabes (that is, their King) had great
plenty of Furres, and much Tabacco. When
we had sufficiently taken Tabacco with them, I
shewed some of our trifles for trade; but they
made signe that they had there nothing to
exchange; for (as I after conceiued) they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
beene fishing and fowling, and so came thither
to lodge that night by vs: for when we were
ready to come away, they shewed vs great cups
made very wittily of barke, in forme almost
square, full of a red berry about the bignesse
of a bullis, which they did eat, and gaue vs by
handfuls; of which (though I liked not the
taste) yet I kept some, because I would by no
meanes but accept their kindnesse. They shewed
me likewise a great piece of fish, whereof I
tasted, and it was fat like Porpoise; and another
kinde of great scaly fish, broiled on the coales,
much like white Salmon, which the Frenchmen
call Aloza, <span class="sidenote"><i>Shad</i></span>for these they would haue had
bread; which I refused, because in maner of
exchange, I would alwayes make the greatest
esteeme I could of our commodities whatsoeuer;
although they saw aboord our Captaine
was liberall to giue them, to the end we might
allure them still to frequent vs. Then they
shewed me foure yoong Goslings, for which
they required foure biskets, but I offered them
two; which they tooke and were well content.</p>

<p>At our departure they made signe, that if any
of vs would stay there on shore, some of them
would go lie aboord vs: at which motion two
of our Company stayed with them, and three
of the Saluages lodged with vs in maner as the
night before.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, being Munday the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
third of June, when they had brought our
men aboord, they came about our ship, earnestly
by signes desiring that we would go with
them along to the maine, for that there they
had Furres and Tabacco to traffique with vs.
Wherefore our Captaine manned the light-horseman
with as many men as he could well,
which were about fifteene with rowers and all;
and we went along with them. Two of their
Canoas they sent away before, and they which
lay aboord vs all night, kept company with vs
to direct vs.</p>

<p>This we noted as we went along, they in their
Canoa with three oares, would at their will go
ahead of vs and about vs, when we rowed with
eight oares strong; such was their swiftnesse,
by reason of the lightnesse and artificiall composition
of their Canoa and oares.</p>

<p>When we came neere the point where we
saw their fires, <span class="sidenote"><i>Pemaquid</i></span>where they intended to land,
and where they imagined some few of vs would
come on shore with our merchandize, as we had
accustomed before; when they had often numbred
our men very diligently, they scoured away
to their Company, not doubting we would haue
followed them. But when we perceiued this,
and knew not either their intents, or number
of Saluages on the shore, our Captaine, after
consultation, stood off, and wefted them to vs,
determining that I should go on shore first to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
take a view of them, and what they had to traffique:
if he, whom at our first sight of them
seemed to be of most respect among them, and
being then in the Canoa, would stay as a pawne
for me. When they came to vs (notwithstanding
all our former courtesies) he vtterly refused;
but would leaue a yoong Saluage: and for him
our Captaine sent Griffin in their Canoa, while
we lay hulling a little off. Griffin at his returne
reported, thay had there assembled together, as
he numbred them, two hundred eighty three
Saluages, euery one his bowe and arrowes, with
their dogges, and wolues which they keepe tame
at command, and not anything to exchange at
all; but would haue drawen vs further vp into a
little narrow nooke of a riuer, for their Furres,
as they pretended.</p>

<p>These things considered, we began to joyne
them in the ranke of other Saluages, who haue
beene by trauellers in most discoueries found
very trecherous; neuer attempting mischiefe,
vntill by some remisnesse, fit opportunity affoordeth
them certaine ability to execute the
same. Wherefore after good advice taken, we
determined so soone as we could to take some
of them, least (being suspitious we had discouered
their plots) they should absent themselues
from vs.</p>

<p>Tuesday, the fourth of June, our men tooke
Cod and Hadocke with hooks by our ship side,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
and Lobsters very great; which before we had
not tried.</p>

<p>About eight a clocke this day we went on
shore with our boats, to fetch aboord water
and wood, our Captaine leauing word with the
Gunner in the shippe, by discharging a musket,
to giue notice if they espied any Canoa
comming; which they did about ten a clocke.
He therefore being carefull they should be
kindly entreated, requested me to go aboord,
intending with dispatch to make what haste
after he possibly could. When I came to the
ship, there were two Canoas, and in either of
them three Saluages; of whom two were below
at the fire, the other staied in their Canoas
about the ship; and because we could not entice
them abord, we gaue them a Canne of pease
and bread, which they carried to the shore to
eat. But one of them brought backe our Canne
presently and staid abord with the other two;
for he being yoong, of a ready capacity, and
one we most desired to bring with vs into
England, had receiued exceeding kinde vsage at
our hands, and was therefore much delighted
in our company. When our Captaine was come,
we consulted how to catch the other three at
shore which we performed thus.</p>

<p>We manned the light horseman with 7 or
8 men, one standing before carried our box
of Marchandise, as we were woont when I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
went to traffique with them, and a platter of
pease, which meat they loued: but before we
were landed, one of them (being too suspitiously
feareful of his owne good) withdrew himselfe
into the wood. The other two met vs on the
shore side, to receiue the pease, with whom we
went vp the Cliffe to their fire and sate downe
with them, and whiles we were discussing how
to catch the third man who was gone, I opened
the box, and shewed them trifles to exchange,
thinking thereby to haue banisht feare from the
other, and drawen him to returne: but when
we could not, we vsed little delay, but suddenly
laid hands vpon them. And it was as much as
fiue or sixe of vs could doe to get them into the
light horseman. For they were strong and so
naked as our best hold was by their long haire
on their heads; and we would haue beene very
loath to haue done them any hurt, which of
necessity we had beene constrained to haue done
if we had attempted them in a multitude, which
we must and would, rather than haue wanted
them, being a matter of great importance for
the full accomplement of our voyage.</p>

<p>Thus we shipped fiue Saluages, two Canoas,
with all their bowes and arrowes.</p>

<p>The next day we made an end of getting
our wood aboord, and filled our empty caske
with water.</p>

<p>Thursday, the 6 of June, we spent in bestowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
the Canoas vpon the orlop safe from
hurt, because they were subject to breaking,
which our Captaine was carefull to preuent.</p>

<p>Saturday the eight of June (our Captaine
being desirous to finish all businesse about this
harbour) very early in the morning, with the
light horseman, coasted fiue or sixe leagues
about the Ilands adjoining, and sounded all
along wheresoeuer we went. He likewise diligently
searched the mouth of the Harbour, and
about the rocks which shew themselues at all
times, and are an excellent breach of the water,
so as no Sea can come in to offend the Harbour.
This he did to instruct himselfe, and thereby
able to direct others that shall happen to come
to this place. For euery where both neere the
rocks, &amp; in all soundings about the Ilands, we
neuer found lesse water than foure and fiue fathoms,
which was seldome; but seuen, eight, nine
and ten fathoms is the continuall sounding by
the shore. In some places much deeper vpon
clay oaze or soft sand: so that if any bound for
this place, should be either driuen or scanted
with winds, he shall be able (with his directions)
to recouer safely his harbour most securely
in water enough by foure seuerall passages, more
than which I thinke no man of judgement will
desire as necessarie.</p>

<p>Vpon one of the Ilands (because it had a
pleasant sandy Coue for small barks to ride in)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
we landed, and found hard by the shore a pond
of fresh water, which flowed ouer the banks,
somewhat ouer growen with little shrub trees,
and searching vp in the Iland, we saw it fed
with a strong run, which with small labour,
and little time, might be made to driue a mill.
In this Iland, as in the other, were spruce trees
of excellent timber and height, able to mast
ships of great burthen.</p>

<p>While we thus sounded from one place to
another in so good deepes, our Captaine to make
some triall of the fishing himselfe, caused a
hooke or two to be cast out at the mouth of the
harbour, not aboue halfe a league from our ship,
where in small time only, with the baits which
they cut from the fish and three hooks, we got
fish enough for our whole Company (though
now augmented) for three daies. Which I omit
not to report, because it sheweth how great a
profit the fishing would be, they being so plentifull,
so great, and so good, with such conuenient
drying as can be wished, neere at hand
vpon the Rocks.</p>

<p>This day, about one a clocke after noone,
came from the Eastward two Canoas abord vs,
wherein was he that refused to stay with vs for
a pawne, and with him six other Saluages which
we had not seene before, who had beautified
themselues after their manner very gallantly,
though their clothing was not differing from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
the former, yet they had newly painted their
faces very deep, some all blacke, some red, with
stripes of excellent blew ouer their vpper lips,
nose and chin. One of them ware a kinde of
Coronet about his head, made very cunningly,
of a substance like stiffe haire coloured red,
broad, and more than a handfull in depth,
which we imagined to be some ensigne of his
superioritie; for he so much esteemed it as he
would not for any thing exchange the same.
Other ware the white feathered skins of some
fowle, round about their head, jewels in their
ears, and bracelets of little white round bone,
fastned together vpon a leather string. These
made not any shew that they had notice of the
other before taken, but we vnderstood them by
their speech and signes, that they came sent
from the Bashabes, and that his desire was that
we would bring vp our ship (which they call
as their owne boats, a Quiden) to his house,
being, as they pointed, vpon the main towards
the East, from whence they came, and that he
would exchange with vs for Furres and Tabacco.
But because our Company was but small,
and now our desire was with speed to discouer
vp the river, we let them vnderstand, that if
their Bashabes would come to vs, he should be
welcome, but we would not remoue to him.
Which when they vnderstood (receiuing of vs
bread and fish, and euery of them a knife) they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
departed; for we had then no will to stay them
long abord, least they should discouer the other
Saluages which we had stowed below.</p>

<p>Tuesday, the 11 of June, we passed vp into
the riuer with our ship, about six and twenty
miles. Of which I had rather not write, then
by my relation to detract from the worthinesse
thereof. For the Riuer, besides that it is subject
by shipping to bring in all traffiques of
Marchandise, a benefit alwaies accounted the
richest treasury to any land: for which cause
our Thames hath that due denomination, and
France by her nauigable Riuers receiueth hir
greatest wealth; yet this place of it selfe from
God and nature affoordeth as much diuersitie
of good commodities, as any reasonable man
can wish, for present habitation and planting.</p>

<p>The first and chiefest thing required, is a bold
coast and faire land to fall with; the next, a safe
harbour for ships to ride in.</p>

<p>The first is a speciall attribute to this shore,
being most free from sands or dangerous rocks
in a continuall good depth, with a most excellent
land-fall, which is the first Iland we fell
with, named by vs, Saint Georges Iland. <span class="sidenote"><i>Monhegan</i></span>For
the second, by judgement of our Captaine, who
knoweth most of the coast of England, and
most of other Countries, (hauing beene experienced
by imployments in discoueries and trauels
from his childhood) and by opinion of others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
of good judgement in our shippe, heere are more
good harbours for ships of all burthens, than
England can affoord, and far more secure from
all winds and weathers, than any in England,
Scotland, France or Spaine. For besides without
the Riuer in the channell, and sounds about
the ilands adjoining to the mouth thereof, no
better riding can be desired for an infinite number
of ships. The Riuer it selfe as it runneth
vp into the main very nigh forty miles toward
the great mountaines, beareth in bredth a mile,
sometime three quarters, and halfe a mile is
the narrowest, where you shall neuer haue
vnder 4 and 5 fathoms water hard by the shore,
but 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 fathoms all along, and on
both sides euery halfe mile very gallant Coues,
some able to conteine almost a hundred saile,
where the ground is excellent soft oaze with
a tough clay vnder for anker hold, and where
ships may ly without either Cable or Anker,
only mored to the shore with a Hauser.</p>

<p>It floweth by their judgement eighteen or
twenty foot at high water.</p>

<p>Heere are made by nature most excellent
places, as Docks to graue or Carine ships of all
burthens; secured from all windes, which is
such a necessary incomparable benefit, that in
few places in England, or in any parts of Christendome,
art, with great charges, can make the
like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>Besides, the bordering land is a most rich
neighbour trending all along on both sides,
in an equall plaine, neither mountainous nor
rocky, but verged with a greene bordure of
grasse, doth make tender vnto the beholder of
hir pleasant fertility, if by clensing away the
woods she were conuerted into meddow.</p>

<p>The wood she beareth is not shrubbish fit
only for fewell, but goodly tall Firre, Spruce,
Birch, Beech, Oke, which in many places is
not so thicke, but may with small labour be
made feeding ground, being plentifull like the
outward Ilands with fresh water, which streameth
downe in many places.</p>

<p>As we passed with a gentle winde vp with
our ship in this Riuer, any man may conceiue
with what admiration we all consented in joy.
Many of our Company who had beene trauellers
in sundry countries, and in the most famous
Riuers, yet affirmed them not comparable to
this they now beheld. Some that were with
Sir Walter Ralegh in his voyage to Guiana, in
the discouery of the Riuer Orenoque, which
echoed fame to the worlds eares, gaue reasons
why it was not to be compared with this, which
wanteth the dangers of many Shoules, and
broken ground, wherewith that was incombred.
Others before that notable Riuer in the West
Indies called Rio Grande; some before the
Riuer of Loyer, the Riuer Seine, and of Burdeaux<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
in France, which although they be great
and goodly Riuers, yet it is no detraction from
them to be accounted inferiour to this, which
not only yeeldeth all the foresaid pleasant profits,
but also appeared infallibly to vs free from
all inconueniences.</p>

<p>I will not prefer it before our riuer of Thames,
because it is Englands richest treasure; but we
all did wish those excellent Harbours, good
deeps in a continuall conuenient breadth, and
small tide-gates, to be as well therein for our
countries good, as we found thē here (beyond
our hopes) in certaine, for those to whom it
shall please God to grant this land for habitation;
which if it had, with the other inseparable
adherent commodities here to be found;
then I would boldly affirme it to be the most
rich, beautifull, large &amp; secure harbouring riuer
that the world affoordeth.</p>

<p>Wednesday, the twelfth of June, our Captaine
manned his light-horseman with 17 men,
and ranne vp from the ship riding in the riuer
vp to the codde thereof, <span class="sidenote"><i>A bend or narrow portion</i></span>where we landed,
leauing six to keepe the light-horseman till
our returne. Ten of vs with our shot, and some
armed, with a boy to carry powder and match,
marched vp into the countrey towards the
mountaines, <span class="sidenote"><i>Camden Hills</i></span>which we descried at our first falling
with the land. Vnto some of them the
riuer brought vs so neere, as we judged our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
selues when we landed to haue beene within
a league of them; but we marched vp about
foure miles in the maine, and passed ouer three
hilles: and because the weather was parching
hot, and our men in their armour not able to
trauel farre and returne that night to our ship,
we resolued not to passe any further, being all
very weary of so tedious and laboursom a trauell.</p>

<p>In this march we passed ouer very good
ground, pleasant and fertile, fit for pasture, for
the space of some three miles, hauing but little
wood, and that Oke like stands left in our pastures
in England, good and great, fit timber for
any vse. Some small Birch, Hazle and Brake,
which might in small time with few men be
cleansed and made good arable land: but as it
now is will feed cattell of all kindes with fodder
enough for Summer and Winter. The soile is
blacke, bearing sundry hearbs, grasse, and strawberries
bigger than ours in England. In many
places are lowe Thicks like our Copisses of
small yoong wood. And surely it did all resemble
a stately Parke, wherein appeare some
old trees with high withered tops, and other
flourishing with liuing greene boughs. Vpon
the hilles grow notable high timber trees, masts
for ships of 400 tun: and at the bottome of
euery hill, a little run of fresh water; but the
furthest and last we passed, ranne with a great
streame able to driue a mill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>We might see in some places where fallow
Deere and Hares had beene, and by the rooting
of ground we supposed wilde Hogs had ranged
there, but we could descrie no beast, because
our noise still chased them from vs.</p>

<p>We were no sooner come aboord our light-horseman,
returning towards our ship, but we
espied a Canoa comming from the further part
of the Cod of the riuer Eastward, which hasted
to vs; wherein, with two others, was he who
refused to stay for a pawne: and his comming
was very earnestly importing to haue one of our
men to go lie on shore with their Bashabes
(who was there on shore, as they signed) and
then the next morning he would come to our
ship with many Furres and Tabacco. This we
perceiued to be only a meere deuice to get
possession of any of our men, to ransome all
those which we had taken, which their naturall
policy could not so shadow, but we did easily
discouer and preuent. These meanes were by
this Saluage practised, because we had one of
his kinsemen prisoner, as we judged by his most
kinde vsage of him being aboord vs together.</p>

<p>Thursday, the 13 of June, by two a clocke
in the morning (because our Captaine would
take the helpe and aduantage of the tide) in
the light-horseman with our Company well
prouided and furnished with armour and shot
both to defend and offend; we went from our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
ship vp to that part of the riuer which trended
Westward into the maine, to search that: <span class="sidenote"><i>Thomaston</i></span>and
we carried with vs a Crosse, to erect at that
point, which (because it was not daylight) we
left on the shore vntill our returne backe; when
we set it vp in maner as the former. For this
(by the way) we diligently obserued, that in
no place, either about the Ilands, or vp in the
maine, or alongst the riuer, we could discerne
any token or signe, that euer any Christian had
beene before; of which either by cutting wood,
digging for water, or setting vp Crosses (a thing
neuer omitted by any Christian trauellers) we
should haue perceiued some mention left.</p>

<p>But to returne to our riuer, further vp into
which we then rowed by estimation twenty
miles, the beauty and goodnesse whereof I can
not by relation sufficiently demonstrate. That
which I can say in generall is this: What profit
or pleasure soeuer is described and truly verified
in the former part of the riuer, is wholly
doubled in this; for the bredth and depth is
such, that any ship drawing 17 or 18 foot water,
might haue passed as farre as we went with our
light-horsman, and by all our mens judgement
much further, because we left it in so good depth
and bredth; which is so much the more to be
esteemed of greater woorth, by how much it
trendeth further vp into the maine: for from
the place of our ships riding in the Harbour at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
the entrance into the Sound, to the furthest
part we were in this riuer, by our estimation
was not much lesse than threescore miles.</p>

<p>From ech banke of this riuer are diuers
branching streames into the maine, wherby is
affoorded an vnspeakable profit by the conueniency
of transportation from place to place,
which in some countries is both chargeable; and
not so fit, by cariages on waine, or horse backe.</p>

<p>Heere we saw great store of fish, some great,
leaping aboue water, which we judged to be
Salmons. All along is an excellent mould of
ground. The wood in most places, especially
on the East side, very thinne, chiefly oke and
some small young birch, bordering low vpon
the riuer; all fit for medow and pasture ground:
and in that space we went, we had on both
sides the riuer many plaine plots of medow,
some of three or foure acres, some of eight
or nine: so as we judged in the whole to be
betweene thirty and forty acres of good grasse,
and where the armes run out into the Maine,
there likewise went a space on both sides of
cleere grasse, how far we know not, in many
places we might see paths made to come downe
to the watering.</p>

<p>The excellencie of this part of the Riuer,
for his good breadth, depth, and fertile bordering
ground, did so ravish vs all with variety of
pleasantnesse, as we could not tell what to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
commend, but only admired; some compared
it to the Riuer Seuerne, (but in a higher degree)
and we all concluded (as I verily thinke we
might rightly) that we should neuer see the
like Riuer in every degree equall, vntill it
pleased God we beheld the same againe. For
the farther we went, the more pleasing it was
to euery man, alluring vs still with expectation
of better, so as our men, although they had
with great labour rowed long and eat nothing
(for we carried with vs no victuall, but a little
cheese and bread) yet they were so refreshed
with the pleasant beholding thereof, and so
loath to forsake it, as some of them affirmed,
they would haue continued willingly with that
onely fare and labour 2 daies; but the tide not
suffering vs to make any longer stay (because
we were to come backe with the tide) and our
Captaine better knowing what was fit then we,
and better what they in labour were able to
endure, being verie loath to make any desperate
hazard, where so little necessitie required,
thought it best to make returne, because whither
we had discouered was sufficient to conceiue
that the Riuer ran very far into the land. For
we passed six or seuen miles, altogether fresh
water (whereof we all dranke) forced vp by
the flowing of the Salt: which after a great
while eb, where we left it, by breadth of channell
and depth of water was likely to run by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
estimation of our whole company an unknowen
way farther: the search whereof our Captaine
hath left till his returne, if it shall so please
God to dispose of him and vs.</p>

<p>For we hauing now by the direction of the
omnipotent disposer of all good intents (far
beyond the period of our hopes) fallen with so
bold a coast, found so excellent and secure harbour,
for as many ships as any nation professing
Christ is able to set forth to Sea, discouered
a Riuer, which the All-creating God, with his
most liberall hand, hath made aboue report notable
with his foresaid blessings, bordered with a
land, whose pleasant fertility bewraieth it selfe
to be the garden of nature, wherin she only
intended to delight hir selfe, hauing hitherto
obscured it to any, except to a purblind generation,
whose vnderstanding it hath pleased
God so to darken, as they can neither discerne,
vse, or rightly esteeme the vnualuable riches
in middest whereof they live sensually content
with the barke and outward rinds, as neither
knowing the sweetnes of the inward marrow,
nor acknowledging the Deity of the Almighty
giuer: hauing I say thus far proceeded, and
hauing some of the inhabitant nation (of best
vnderstanding we saw among them) who (learning
our language) may be able to giue vs further
instruction, concerning all the premised
particulars, as also of their gouernours, and gouernment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
situation of townes, and what else shall
be conuenient, which by no meanes otherwise
we could by any obseruation of our selues learne
in a long time: our Captaine now wholy intended
his prouision for speedy returne. For
although the time of yeere and our victuall
were not so spent, but we could haue made a
longer voyage, in searching farther and trading
for very good commodities, yet as they might
haue beene much profitable, so (our company
being small) much more preiudiciall to the
whole state of our voyage, which we were most
regardfull now not to hazard. For we supposing
not a little present priuate profit, but a publique
good, and true zeale of promulgating Gods holy
Church, by planting Christianity, to be the sole
intent of the Honourable setters foorth of this
discouery; thought it generally most expedient,
by our speedy returne, to giue the longer
space of time to make prouision for so weighty
an enterprise.</p>

<p>Friday, the 14 day of June, early by foure a
clocke in the morning, with the tide, our two
boats, and a little helpe of the winde, we rowed
downe to the riuers mouth and there came to
an anker about eleuen a clocke. Afterward our
Captaine in the light horseman searched the
sounding all about the mouth and comming to
the Riuer, for his certaine instruction of a perfect
description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>The next day, being Saturday, we wayed anker,
and with a briese from the land, we sailed
vp to our watering place, and there stopped,
went on shore and filled all our empty caske
with fresh water.</p>

<p>Our Captaine vpon the Rocke in the middest
of the harbour obserued the height, latitude, and
variation exactly vpon his instruments.</p>

<p class="noindent pad2">
1 Astrolabe.<br />
2 Semisphere.<br />
3 Ringe instrument.<br />
4 Crosse staffe.<br />
5 And an excellent compasse made for the variation.<br />
</p>

<p>The certainty whereof, together with the
particularities of euery depth and sounding, as
well at our falling with the land, as in the discouery,
and at our departure from the coast;
I refer to his owne relation in the Map of his
Geographicall description, which for the benefit
of others he intendeth most exactly to publish.</p>

<p>The temperature of the Climate (albeit a very
important matter) I had almost passed without
mentioning, because it affoorded to vs no great
alteration from our disposition in England;
somewhat hotter vp into the Maine, because it
lieth open to the South; the aire so wholesome,
as I suppose not any of vs found our selues at
any time more healthfull, more able to labour,
nor with better stomacks to such good fare, as
we partly brought, and partly found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>Sunday, the 16 of June, the winde being faire,
and because we had set out of England vpon a
Sunday, made the Ilands vpon a Sunday, and as
we doubt not (by Gods appointment) happily
fell into our harbour vpon a Sunday; so now
(beseeching him still with like prosperity to
blesse our returne into England our country, and
from thence with his good will and pleasure to
hasten our next arriuall there) we waied Anker
and quit the Land vpon a Sunday.</p>

<p>Tuesday, the 18 day, being not run aboue 30
leagues from land, and our Captaine for his certaine
knowledge how to fall with the coast, hauing
sounded euery watch, and from 40 fathoms
had come into good deeping, to 70, and so to
an hundred: this day the weather being faire,
after the foure a clocke watch, when we supposed
not to haue found ground so farre from
land, and before sounded in aboue 100 fathoms,
we had ground in 24 fathomes. <span class="sidenote"><i>The Fishing Banks</i></span>Wherefore
our sailes being downe, Thomas King boatswaine,
presently cast out a hooke, and before
he judged it at ground, was fished and haled
vp an exceeding great and well fed Cod: then
there were cast out 3 or 4 more, and the fish
was so plentifull and so great, as when our
Captaine would haue set saile, we all desired
him to suffer them to take fish a while, because
we were so delighted to see them catch so great
fish, so fast as the hooke came down: some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
with playing with the hooke they tooke by the
backe, and one of the Mates with two hookes
at a lead at fiue draughts together haled vp
tenne fishes; all were generally very great, some
they measured to be fiue foot long, and three
foot about.</p>

<p>This caused our Captaine not to maruell at
the shoulding, for he perceiued it was a fish
banke, which (for our farewell from the land)
it pleased God in continuance of his blessings
to giue vs knowledge of: the abundant profit
whereof should be alone sufficient cause to draw
men againe, if there were no other good both
in present certaine, and in hope probable to
be discouered. To amplifie this with words,
were to adde light to the Sunne: for euery one
in the shippe could easily account this present
commodity; much more those of judgement,
which knew what belonged to fishing, would
warrant (by the helpe of God) in a short voyage
with few good fishers to make a more profitable
returne from hence than from Newfoundland:
the fish being so much greater, better
fed, and abundant with traine; <span class="sidenote"><i>Cod-liver oil</i></span>of which some
they desired, and did bring into England to
bestow among their friends, and to testifie the
true report.</p>

<p>After, we kept our course directly for England
&amp; with ordinary winds, and sometime
calmes, vpon Sunday the 14 of July about sixe a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
clocke at night, we were come into sounding
in our channell, but with darke weather and
contrary winds, we were constrained to beat
vp and downe till Tuesday the 16 of July, when
by fiue a clocke in the morning we made Sylly;
from whence, hindered with calmes and small
winds, vpon Thursday the 18 of July about
foure a clocke after noone, we came into Dartmouth:
which Hauen happily (with Gods gracious
assistance) we made our last and first
Harbour in England.</p>

<p>Further, I haue thought fit here to adde some
things worthy to be regarded, which we haue
obserued from the Saluages since we tooke
them.</p>

<p>First, although at the time when we surprised
them, they made their best resistance, not
knowing our purpose, nor what we were, nor
how we meant to vse them; yet after perceiuing
by their kinde vsage we intended them no
harme, they haue neuer since seemed discontented
with vs, but very tractable, louing, &amp;
willing by their best meanes to satisfie vs in any
thing we demand of them, by words or signes
for their vnderstanding: neither haue they at
any time beene at the least discord among themselues;
insomuch as we haue not seene them
angry but merry; and so kinde, as if you giue
any thing to one of them, he will distribute part
to euery one of the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>We haue brought them to vnderstand some
English, and we vnderstand much of their language;
so as we are able to aske them many
things. And this we haue obserued, that if we
shew them any thing, and aske them if they
haue it in their countrey, they will tell you if
they haue it, and the vse of it, the difference
from ours in bignesse, colour, or forme; but if
they haue it not, be it a thing neuer so precious,
they wil denie the knowledge of it.</p>

<p>They haue names for many starres, which
they will shew in the firmament.</p>

<p>They shew great reuerence to their King,
and are in great subiection to their Gouernours:
and they will shew a great respect to any we
tell them are our Commanders.</p>

<p>They shew the maner how they make bread
of their Indian wheat, and how they make butter
and cheese of the milke they haue of the
Rain-Deere and Fallo-Deere, which they haue
tame as we haue Cowes.</p>

<p>They haue excellent colours. And hauing
seene our Indico, they make shew of it, or of
some other like thing which maketh as good
a blew.</p>

<p>One especiall thing is their maner of killing
the Whale, which they call Powdawe; and will
describe his forme; how he bloweth vp the
water; and that he is 12 fathoms long; and that
they go in company of their King with a multitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
of their boats, and strike him with a bone
made in fashion of a harping iron fastened to
a rope, which they make great and strong of
the barke of trees, which they veare out after
him; then all their boats come about him, and
as he riseth aboue water, with their arrowes
they shoot him to death; when they haue killed
him &amp; dragged him to shore, they call all their
chiefe lords together, &amp; sing a song of joy: and
those chiefe lords, whom they call Sagamos,
divide the spoile, and giue to euery man a share,
which pieces so distributed they hang vp about
their houses for prouision: and when they boile
them, they blow off the fat, and put to their
peaze, maiz, and other pulse, which they eat.</p>

which was chartered by King James in 1606, who lived
at Plymouth and elsewhere in the west of England.
The London members of the Company made their settlement
at Jamestown. The leader of the Plymouth partners
was Sir Ferdinando Gorges, with whom were
associated members of the Popham and Gilbert families.
They equipped two exploring expeditions in the autumn
of 1606, one of them being under the command of Martin
Pring, whose account of his voyage of 1603 is printed
in this volume. Pring’s report determined the Plymouth
partners to attempt a settlement on the Maine coast.
Two vessels were fitted out and George Popham, a
nephew of the Chief Justice, Sir John Popham, and
Ralegh Gilbert, a son of Sir Humphrey, were placed in
charge of the expedition.</em></p>

<p><em>The narrative of the voyage was written by one of
the officers, probably the navigator or pilot of Gilbert’s
vessel, the “Mary and John,” whose name may have
been James Davies. This account, which is preserved
in the Library of Lambeth Palace, London, was printed
in the fourth volume of the Gorges Society publications,
Portland, 1892, with notes by the Rev. Henry O.
Thayer. That Society, through Mr. H. W. Bryant of
Portland, has kindly loaned the facsimiles of the drawings
which illustrate the manuscript, for reproduction
in this volume.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Henry Hudson</span>, <em>having tried in vain to find a sea
route to China through the ice fields which stretched
across his path all the way from Greenland to Spitzbergen
or Willoughby Land, transferred his services in
the winter of 1609 from the English Muscovy Company
to the Dutch East India Company. He started to make
a further trial of the Northeast passage, but while off
the coast of Novaya Zemlya, his crews refused to go
further in that direction. Abandoned by his consort,
Hudson persuaded the men on his own ship, the Half
Moon, to cross the Atlantic and try their luck in America.
They made land on the Nova Scotia coast, and
after beating about over the fishing banks and looking
at the shores of Maine and southeastern Massachusetts,
went on to another landfall in the latitude of Virginia.
Turning northward, they sailed up the coast and into
the river which has since borne their leader’s name.</em></p>

<p><em>The surviving log-book or journal of Hudson’s third
voyage was kept by Robert Juet, who had been his mate
during the second voyage, and who took a leading part
in the mutiny which ended when the leader was turned
adrift in a small boat in Hudson’s Bay in 1611. It was
printed in the third volume of “Purchas his Pilgrimes,”
London, 1625.</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE twelfth of July was very foggie, <span class="sidenote"><i>1609 July</i></span>
we stood our course all the morning
till eleven of the clocke; at which
time we had sight of land, which is low white
sandie ground, right on head off us; and had
ten fathoms. Then we tackt to the southward,
and stood off foure glasses: then we tackt to
the land againe, thinking to have rode under it,
and as we came neere it, the fog was so thicke
that we could not see; so wee stood off againe.
From mid-night to two of the clocke, we came
sounding in twelve, thirteene, and fourteene
fathoms off the shoare. At foure of the clocke,
we had 20 fathoms. At eight of the clocke at
night, 30 fathoms. At twelve of the clocke,
65 fathoms, and but little winde, for it deeped
apace, but the neerer the shoare the fairer
shoalding.</p>

<p>The thirteenth, faire sun-shining weather,
from eight of the clocke in the fore-noone all
day after, but in the morning it was foggie.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
Then at eight of the clocke we cast about for
the shoare, but could not see it; the wind being
at south by our true compasse, wee steered
west and by north. At noone we observed, and
found our height to bee 43 degrees, 25 minutes;
so we steered away west and by north all
the afternoone. At foure of the clocke in the
afternoone we sounded, and had five and thirtie
fathoms. And at sixe of the clocke wee had
sight of the land, and saw two sayles on head
off us. The land by the waters side is low land,
and white sandie bankes rising, full of little
hils. Our soundings were 35, 33, 30, 28, 32,
37, 33, and 32 fathoms.</p>

<p>The fourteenth, full of mysts flying and
vading, the wind betweene south and south-west;
we steered away west north-west, and
north-west and by west. Our soundings were
29, 25, 24, 25, 22, 25, 27, 30, 28, 30, 35, 43,
50, 70, 90, 70, 64, 86, 100 fathoms, and no
ground.</p>

<p>The fifteenth, very mystie, the winde varying
betweene south and south-west; wee steered
west and by north, and west north-west. In the
morning we sounded, and had one hundred
fathoms, till foure of the clocke in the afternoone.
Then we sounded againe, and had seventie-five
fathoms. Then in two glasses running,
which was not above two English miles, we
sounded and had sixtie fathoms, and it shoalded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
a great pace untill we came to twentie fathoms.
Then we made account we were neere the
islands that lie off the shoare. So we came to
an anchor, the sea being very smooth and little
wind, at nine of the clocke at night. After supper
we tryed for fish, and I caught fifteene cods,
some the greatest that I have seene, and so we
rode all night.</p>

<p>The sixteenth, in the morning, it cleered up,
and we had sight of five islands <span class="sidenote"><i>Eastern Maine</i></span>lying north, and
north and by west from us, two leagues. Then
wee made ready to set sayle, but the myst came
so thicke that we durst not enter in among
them.</p>

<p>The seventeenth, was all mystie, so that we
could not get into the harbour. At ten of the
clocke two boats came off to us, with sixe of
the savages of the countrey, seeming glad of
our comming. We gave them trifles, and they
eate and dranke with us; and told us that there
were gold, silver and copper mynes hard by
us; and that the French-men doe trade with
them; which is very likely, for one of them
spake some words of French. So wee rode still
all day and all night, the weather continuing
mystie.</p>

<p>The eighteenth, faire weather, wee went
into a very good harbour, and rode hard by the
shoare in foure fathoms water. The river runneth
up a great way, <span class="sidenote"><i>Penobscot</i></span>but there is but two fathoms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
hard by us. We went on shoare and cut
us a fore mast; then at noone we came aboord
againe, and found the height of the place to
bee in 44 degrees, 1 minute, and the sunne to
fall at a south south-west sunne. We mended
our sayles, and fell to make our fore-mast. The
harbour lyeth south and north, a mile in where
we rode.</p>

<p>The nineteenth, we had faire sun-shining
weather, we rode still. In the after-noone wee
went with our boate to looke for fresh water,
and found some; and found a shoald with many
lobsters on it, and caught one and thirtie. The
people coming aboord, shewed us great friendship,
but we could not trust them. The twentieth,
faire sunne-shining weather, the winde
at south-west. In the morning, our scute went
out to catch fresh fish halfe an houre before
day, and returned in two houres, bringing seven
and twentie great coddes, with two hookes and
lines. In the afternoone wee went for more
lobsters and caught fortie, and returned aboord.
Then wee espied two French shallops full of the
country people come into the harbour, but they
offered us no wrong, seeing we stood upon our
guard. They brought many beaver skinnes and
other fine furres, which they would have changed
for redde gownes. For the French trade with
them for red cassocks, knives, hatchets, copper,
kettles, trevits, beades, and other trifles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>The one and twentieth, all mystie, the wind
easterly, wee rode still and did nothing, but
about our mast. The two and twentieth, fair
sun-shining weather, the winde all northerly,
we rode still all the day. In the after-noone our
scute went to catch more lobsters, and brought
with them nine and fiftie. The night was cleere
weather.</p>

<p>The three and twentieth, faire sun shining
weather and very hot. At eleven of the clocke
our fore mast was finished, and wee brought it
aboord, and set it into the step, and in the after-noone
we rigged it. This night we had some
little myst and rayne.</p>

<p>The foure and twentieth, very hot weather,
the winde at south out of the sea. The fore-part
of the day wee brought to our sayles. In
the morning our scute went to take fish, and
in two houres they brought with them twentie
great coddes and a great holibut; the night
was faire also. We kept good watch for fear
of being betrayed by the people, and perceived
where they layd their shallops.</p>

<p>The five and twentieth, very faire weather
and hot. In the morning wee manned our scute
with foure muskets and sixe men, and tooke
one of their shallops and brought it aboord.
Then we manned our boat and scute with twelve
men and muskets, and two stone pieces or murderers,
and drave the savages from their houses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
and tooke the spoyle of them, as they would
have done of us. Then wee set sayle, and came
downe to the harbours mouth, and rode there
all night, because the winde blew right in, and
the night grew mystie with much rayne till
mid-night. Then it fell calme, and the wind
came off the land at west north-west, and it
began to cleere. The compasse varyed ten degrees
north-west.</p>

<p>The sixe and twentieth, faire and cleere
sunne-shining weather. At five of the clocke
in the morning, the winde being off the shoare
at north north-west, we set sayle and came to
sea, and by noone we counted our ship had
gone fourteene leagues south-west. In the afternoone,
the winde shifted variably betweene
west south-west and north-west. At noone I
found the height to bee 43 degrees, 56 minutes.
This evening being very faire weather,
wee observed the variation of our compasse at
the sunnes going downe, and found it to bee 10
degrees from the north to the westward.</p>

<p>The seven and twentieth, faire sun-shining
weather, the winde shifting betweene the
south-west and west and by north, a stiffe gale;
we stood to the southward all day, and made
our way south and by west, seven and twentie
leagues. At noone, our height was 42 degrees,
50 minutes. At foure of the clocke in the
after-noone, wee cast about to the north-ward.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
At eight of the clocke, we tooke in our top-sayles
and our fore-bonnet, and went with a
short sayle all night.</p>

<p>The eight and twentieth, very thicke and
mystie, and a stiffe gale of wind, varying betweene
south south-west and south-west and by
west; we made our way north-west and by west,
seven and twentie leagues; wee sounded many
times and could get no ground. At five of the
clocke we cast about to the southward, the wind
at south-west and by west. At which time we
sounded, and had ground at seventie-five fathoms.
At eight, wee had sixtie-five fathoms.
At ten, sixtie. At twelve of the clocke at mid-night,
fiftie-sixe fathoms, gray sand.</p>

<p>The compasse varyed 6 degrees the north
point to the west.</p>

<p>The nine and twentieth, faire weather, we
stood to the southward, and made our way south
and by west a point south, eighteene leagues.
At noone we found our height to be 42 degrees
56 minutes; wee sounded oft and had these,
60, 64, 65, 67, 65, 65, 70, and 75 fathoms.
At night wee tryed the variation of our compasse
by the setting of the sunne, and found
that it went downe 37 degrees to the northward
of the west, and should have gone downe but
31 degrees. The compasse varyed 5 and a halfe
degrees.</p>

<p>The thirtieth, very hot, all the fore part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
the day calme, the wind at south south-east;
wee steered away west south-west and sounded
many times, and could find no ground at one
hundred and seventie fathomes. We found a
great current and many over-falls. Our current
had deceived us. For at noone we found our
height to be 41 degrees 34 minutes. And the
current had heaved us to the southward foureteene
leagues. At eight of the clocke at night
I sounded, and had ground in fiftie-two fathomes.
In the end of the mid-night watch wee
had fiftie-three fathomes. This last observation
is not to be trusted.</p>

<p>The one and thirtieth, very thicke and mystie
all day, untill tenne of the clocke. At night
the wind came to the south, and south-west
and south. We made our way west north-west
nineteene leagues. Wee sounded many times,
and had difference of soundings, sometimes
little stones, and sometimes grosse gray sand,
fiftie-sixe, fiftie-foure, fortie-eight, fortie-seven,
fortie-foure, fortie-sixe, fiftie fathoms; and at
eight of the clocke at night it fell calme, and
we had fiftie fathomes. And at ten of the clocke
we heard a great rut, like the rut of the shoare.
Then I sounded and found the former depth;
and mistrusting a current, seeing it so still that
the ship made no way, I let the lead lie on the
ground, and found a tide set to the south-west,
and south-west and by west, so fast, that I could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
hardly vere the line so fast, and presently came
an hurling current, or tyde with over-fals, which
cast our ship round; and the lead was so fast
in the ground that I feared the lines breaking,
and we had no more but that. At midnight I
sounded againe, and we had seventie-five fathomes;
and the strong streame had left us.</p>

<p>The first of August, <span class="sidenote"><i>August</i></span>all the fore part of the
day was mystie, and at noone it cleered up.
We found that our height was 41 degrees 45
minutes, and we had gone nineteene leagues.
The after-noon was reasonable cleere. We
found a rustling tide or current with many over-fals
to continue still, and our water to change
colour, and our sea to bee very deepe, for wee
found no ground in one hundred fathomes. The
night was cleere, and the winde came to the
north, and north north-east, we steered west.</p>

<p>The second, very faire weather and hot:
from the morning till noone we had a gale of
wind, but in the after-noone little wind. At
noone I sounded and had one hundred and
ten fathomes; and our height was 41 degrees
56 minutes. And wee had runne four and twentie
leagues and an halfe. At the sun-setting
we observed the variation of the compasse, and
found that it was come to his true place. At
eight of the clocke the gale increased, so wee
ranne sixe leagues that watch, and had a very
faire and cleere night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>The third, very hot weather. In the morning
we had sight of the land, <span class="sidenote"><i>Cape Malabar</i></span>and steered in
with it, thinking to go to the northward of it.
So we sent our shallop with five men to sound
in by the shore: and they found it deepe five
fathomes within bow-shot of the shoare; and
they went on land, and found goodly grapes and
rose trees, and brought them aboord with them,
at five of the clocke in the eevening. We had
seven and twentie fathomes within two miles
of the shoare; and we found a floud come from
the south-east, and an ebbe from the northwest,
with a very strong streame, and a great hurling
and noyses. At eight of the clocke at night the
wind began to blow a fresh gale, and continued
all night but variable. Our sounding that
wee had to the land was one hundred, eightie,
seventie-foure, fiftie-two, fortie-sixe, twentie-nine,
twentie-seven, twentie-foure, nineteene,
seventeene, sometimes oze, and sometimes gray
sand.</p>

<p>The fourth, was very hot: we stood to the
north-west two watches, and one south in for
the land, and came to an anchor at the norther
end of the headland, and heard the voyce of
men call. Then we sent our boat on shoare,
thinking they had beene some Christians left on
the land: but wee found them to bee savages,
which seemed very glad of our comming. So
wee brought one aboord with us, and gave him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
meate, and he did eate and drinke with us.
Our master gave him three or foure glasse buttons,
and sent him on land with our shallop
againe. And at our boats comming from the
shoare he leapt and danced, and held up his
hands, and pointed us to a river on the other
side: for we had made signes that we came to
fish there. The bodie of this headland lyeth
in 41 degrees 45 minutes. We set sayle againe
after dinner, thinking to have got to the westward
of this headland, but could not; so we
beare up to the southward of it, and made a
south-east way; and the souther point did beare
west at eight of the clocke at night. Our
soundings about the easter and norther part of
this headland, a league from the shoare are
these: at the easterside thirtie, twentie-seven,
twentie-seven, twentie-foure, twentie-five, twentie.
The north-east point 17 degrees 18 minutes,
and so deeper. The north end of this
headland, hard by the shoare thirtie fathomes:
and three leagues off north north-west, one hundred
fathomes. At the south-east part a league
off, fifteene, sixteene, and seventeene fathomes.
The people have greene tabacco and pipes, the
boles whereof are made of earth and the pipes
of red copper. The land is very sweet.</p>

<p>The fift, all mystie. At eight of the clocke
in the morning wee tact about to the westward,
and stood in till foure of the clocke in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
the after-noone; at which time it cleered, and
wee had sight of the head-land againe five
leagues from us. The souther point of it did
beare west off us: and we sounded many times,
and had no ground. And at foure of the clocke
we cast about, and at our staying wee had
seventie fathomes. Wee steered away south
and south by east all night, and could get no
ground at seventie and eightie fathomes. For
wee feared a great riffe that lyeth off the land,
and steered away south and by east.</p>

<p>The sixth, faire weather, but many times
mysting. Wee steered away south south-east,
till eight of the clocke in the morning; then
it cleered a little, and we cast about to the
westward. Then we sounded and had thirtie
fathomes, grosse sand, and were come to the
riffe. Then wee kept our lead, and had quicke
shoalding from thirtie, twentie-nine, twentie-seven,
twentie-foure, twentie-two, twentie and
an halfe, twentie, twentie, nineteene, nineteene,
nineteene, eighteene, eighteene, seventeene;
and so deeping againe as proportionally
as it shoalded. For we steered south and south-east
till we came to twentie-sixe fathomes.
Then we steered south-west, for so the tyde
doth set. By and by, it being calme, we tryed
by our lead; for you shall have sixteene or seventeene
fathomes, and the next cast but seven
or six fathomes. And farther to the westward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
you shall have foure and five foot water, and see
rockes under you and you shall see the land
in the top. Upon this riffe we had an observation,
and found that it lyeth in 40 degrees,
10 minutes. And this is that headland which
Captaine Bartholomew Gosnold discovered in
the yeere 1602, and called Cape Cod, because
of the store of cod-fish that hee found thereabout.
So we steered south-west three leagues,
and had twentie and twentie-foure fathomes.
Then we steered west two glasses, halfe a league,
and came to fifteene fathomes. Then we steered
off south-east foure glasses, but could not get
deepe water; for there the tyde of ebbe laid us
on; and the streame did hurle so, that it laid us
so neere the breach of a shoald that wee were
forced to anchor. So at seven of the clocke at
night wee were at an anchor in tenne fathomes:
and I give God most heartie thankes, the least
water wee had was seven fathomes and an halfe.
We rode still all night, and at a still water I
sounded so farre round about our ship as we
could see a light; and had no lesse then eight,
nine, ten, and eleven fathomes: the myst continued
being very thicke.</p>

<p>The seventh, faire weather and hot, but mystie.
Wee rode still hoping it would cleere, but
on the floud it fell calme and thicke. So we
rode still all day and all night. The floud commeth
from the south-west, and riseth not above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
one fathome and an halfe in nepe streames.
Toward night it cleered, and I went with our
shallop and sounded, and found no lesse water
then eight fathomes to the south-east off us; but
we saw to the north-west off us great breaches.</p>

<p>The eight, faire and cleere weather. In the
morning, by sixe of the clocke, at slake water,
wee weighed, the wind at north-east, and set
our fore-sayle and mayne top-sayle, and got a
mile over the flats. Then the tyde of ebbe came,
so we anchored againe till the floud came.
Then we set sayle againe, and by the great mercie
of God wee got cleere off them by one of
the clocke this afternoone. And wee had sight
of the land from the west north-west to the
north north-west. So we steered away south
south-east all night, and had ground untill the
middle of the third watch. Then we had fortie-five
fathomes, white sand and little stones.
So all our soundings are twentie, twentie, twentie-two,
twentie-seven, thirtie-two, fortie-three,
fortie-three, fortie-five. Then no ground in
seventie fathomes.</p>

he demonstrated the possibility of making the voyage
from England by a more direct route than that by
way of the Azores and the West Indies. For the next
decade Argall was constantly associated with the affairs
of the Jamestown colony. In 1610 he reached the settlement
with supplies and recruits from England barely
in time to prevent its abandonment. As the provisions
which he brought afforded only a temporary relief, he
started off at once for the Bermudas. His experiences
during the voyage are told in his journal, which is here
reprinted from the fourth volume of “Purchas his Pilgrimes,”
printed at London in 1625.</em></p>

<p><em>Argall made two more voyages to the New England
coast in 1613, first to investigate the reports that the
French were making settlements on Mount Desert and
at the mouth of the St. Croix River, and then to complete
the destruction of the houses and fortifications begun
by the French. For reasons of policy, it may be, no detailed

<p class="drop-cap">SIR GEORGE SUMMERS, being
bound for the Ile of Bermuda with two
Pinnaces, <span class="sidenote"><i>1610 June</i></span>the one called the Patience,
wherein he sailed himselfe, set saile from Iames
Towne in Virginia, the ninteenth of Iune, 1610.
The two and twentieth at noone we came to
an anchor at Cape Henry, to take more balast.
The weather proued very wet: so wee road
vnder the Cape till two of the clocke, the
three and twentieth in the morning. Then we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
weighed and stood off to Sea, the wind at
South-west. And till eight of the clocke at
night it was all Southerly, and then that shifted
to South-west. The Cape then bearing West,
about eight leagues off. Then wee stirred <span class="sidenote"><i>Steered</i></span>away
South-east. The foure and twentieth, at noone
I obserued the Sunne, and found my selfe to
bee in thirtie sixe degrees, fortie seuen minutes,
about twentie leagues off from the Land.
From the foure and twentieth at noone, to the
fiue and twentieth at noone, sixe leagues East,
the wind Southerly, but for the most part it
was calme. From the fiue and twentieth at
noone, to the sixe and twentieth about sixe of
the clocke in the morning, the winde was all
Southerly, and but little. And then it beganne
to blow a fresh gale at West South-west.
So by noone I had sailed fourteene leagues
East, South-east pricked. From the sixe and
twentieth at noone, to the seuen and twentieth
at noone, twentie leagues East, South-east.
The wind shifting from the West, South-west
Southerly, and so to the East, and the weather
faire, but close. From the seuen and twentieth
at noone, to the eight and twentieth at noone,
sixe and twentie leagues East, South-east, the
wind shifting backe againe from the East to the
West. Then by mine obseruation I found the
ship to be in thirtie fiue degrees fiftie foure minutes.
From the eight and twentieth at noone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
to the nine and twentieth at noone, thirtie sixe
leagues East by South, the wind at West, North-west.
Then by my obseruation I found the ship
to be in thirtie fiue degrees, thirtie minutes
pricked. From the nine and twentieth at noone
to the thirtieth at noone, thirtie fiue leagues
East, South-east. The winde shifting betweene
West, North-west, and West, South-west, blowing
a good fresh gale. Then by my obseruation
I found the ship to be in thirtie foure
degrees, fortie nine minutes pricked. From the
thirtieth of Iune at noone, to the first of Iuly
at noone, thirtie leagues South-east by East, the
winde at west, then I found the ship in thirtie
foure degrees pricked.</p>

<p>From the first of Iuly at noone, <span class="sidenote"><i>July</i></span>to the second
at noon, twentie leagues East, South-east southerly,
the wind West, then I found the ship to bee
in thirtie three degrees, thirtie minutes pricked,
the weather very faire. From the second at
noone, to the third at foure of the clocke in
the afternoone it was calme, then it beganne
to blow a resonable fresh gale at South-east:
so I made account that the ship had driuen
about sixe leagues in that time East. The Sea
did set all about the West. From that time to
the fourth at noone, seuenteen leagues East by
North, the wind shifting betweene South-east
and South South-west, then I found the ship to
bee in thirtie three degrees, fortie minutes, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
weather continued very faire. From the fourth
at noone, to the fifth at noone, ten leagues
South-east, the wind and weather as before, then
I found the ship to be in thirtie three degrees,
seuenteene minutes pricked. From the fift at
noone, to the sixt at noone, eight leagues South-west,
then I found the ship to be in thirtie
two degrees, fiftie seuen minutes pricked; the
wind and weather continued as before, only we
had a small showre or two of raine. From the
sixt at noone, to the seuenth at noone, seuenteene
leagues East by North, then I found the
ship to be in thirtie three degrees, the wind
and weather as before. From the seuenth at
noon, to the eight at noone, fourteene leagues
North-east, then I found the ship to be in thirtie
three degrees, thirtie two minutes, the wind
and weather continued as before. From the
eight at noon to the ninth at noone, fiue leagues
South-east, there I found the ship to be in thirtie
three degrees, twentie one minutes, the wind
at South-west, the weather very faire. From
the ninth at noone, to the tenth at noone, fiue
leagues South, the wind westerly; but for the
most part it was calme, and the weather very
faire. From the tenth at noone, to the eleuenth
at noone it was calme, and so continued vntill
nine of the clocke the same night, then it began
to blow a reasonable fresh gale at South-east,
and continued all that night betweene South-east<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
and South, and vntill the twelfth day at
noone: by which time I had sailed fifteene
leagues West southerly: then I found the ship
in thirtie three degrees, thirtie minutes. From
that time to foure of the clock the twelfth day
in the morning twelue leagues West by North,
the wind all southerly, and then it shifted betweene
South and South-west, then wee tacked
about and stood South-east, and South-east by
South: so by noone I had sayled fiue leagues
South-east by East; then I found the ship in
thirtie three degrees ten minutes. From the
thirteenth at noone, to the fourteenth at noone,
twenty leagues South-east by East, the wind
shifting betweene the South-west, and West
South-west, then I found the ship to be in thirtie
two degrees, thirtie fiue minutes. From the
fourteenth at noone, to the fifteenth at noone,
twentie leagues South-east, then I found the
ship to be in thirty two degrees, the wind as
before: then we tacked about, and lay North-west
by West. From the fifteenth at noone, to
the sixteenth at noone, twelue leagues North by
West, the wind shifting betweene South-west
and West, and the weather very stormy, with
many sudden gusts of wind and rayne.</p>

<p>And about sixe of the clocke in the after-noone,
being to windward of our Admirall I
bare vp vnder his lee: who when I hayled him,
told me that he would tack it vp no longer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
because hee was not able to keepe the sea any
longer, for lacke of a road and water: but that
hee would presently steere away North North-west,
to see if he could fetch Cape Cod. Which
without delay he put in execution. His directions
I followed: so from the sixteenth day at
noone, to the seuenteenth at noone I had sailed
thirtie eight leagues North North-west: then
I found my ship to be in thirtie foure degrees,
ten minutes. The seuenteenth and eighteenth
dayes were very wet and stormy, and the winds
shifting all points of the Compasse. The nineteenth
day, about foure of the clocke in the
morning it began to cleere vp, and then we had
a very stiffe gale betweene East and North-east.
From the seuenteenth at noone, to the nineteenth
at noone, I had sayled fiftie fiue leagues
North North-west, then I found the ship to
be thirtie sixe degrees, thirty minutes. From
the nineteenth at noone, to the twentieth at
noone, thirty fiue leagues North-west: then I
was in thirty seuen degrees, fifty two minutes,
the weather now was fairer and the wind all
easterly. From the twentieth at noone, to the
twentie one at noone, we sayled twenty leagues
North by West, the wind betweene East and
South-east, and the weather very faire. At the
sunne setting I obserued, and found thirteene
degrees, and an halfe of westerly variation, and
vntill midnight we had a reasonable fresh gale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
of wind all southerly, and then it fell calme and
rained, and so continued very little wind vntill
the two and twentieth at noone, and shifting
all the points of the Compasse: yet by mine
obseruation that I made then, I found that the
ship had run twentie fiue leagues North, for I
found her to be in forty degrees, one minute,
which maketh me thinke that there was some
tide or current that did set Northward. Againe,
those that had the second watch did say, That
in their watch they did see a race, and that ship
did driue apace to the Northward, when she
had not a breath of wind.</p>

<p>From the two and twentieth at noone, vntill
ten of the clocke at night, we had a fresh
gale of wind, betweene East and South-east, and
then it shifted all westerly, and so continued
vntill two of the clocke the twenty three in the
morning: and then it began to be very foggy
and but little wind, yet shifting all the points
of the Compasse, and so continued vntill ten of
the clocke and then it began to cleere vp. At
twelue of the clocke I obserued, and then I
found the ship to be in fortie degrees fiftie
minutes: so from the twenty two at noone, to
the twenty three at noone I had sayled twenty
leagues Northward. From the twenty three at
noone, to the twenty foure, at three of the clocke
in the morning it was calme, and then we had
a reasonable fresh gale of wind all southerly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
and so it continued vntill noon southerly, in
which time I had sailed twelue leagues North.
And about foure of the clocke in the afternoone,
we had forty seuen fathoms of water, <span class="sidenote"><i>Fishing Banks</i></span>
which water we did find to be changed into a
grasse green in the morning, yet we would not
heaue a lead, because our Admirall was so farre
on head of vs: who about three of the clocke in
the afternoone lay by the lee, and fished till I
came vp to him: and then I fitted my selfe and
my boat, and fished vntill sixe of the clocke.
And then the Admirall fitted his sailes, and
stirred away North, whom I followed with all
the speed I could. But before seuen of the
clocke there fell such a myst, that I was faine
to shoot off a Peece, which he answered with
a Cornet that he had aboord. So with hallowing
and making a noyse one to another all the
night we kept company. About two of the
clocke, the twenty fiue day in the morning we
tooke in all our sailes, and lay at Hull vntill
fiue of the clocke: and then finding but small
store of fish, we set saile and stirred away North-west,
to fetch the mayne land to relieue our
selues with wood and water, which we stood in
great need of. About two of the clocke in the
afternoone we tooke in all our sailes and lay at
Hull, at which time I heaued the lead three
times together, and had three sundry kindes of
soundings. The first a blacke peppery sand, full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
of peble stones. The second blacke peppery,
and no stones: The third, blacke peppery, and
two or three stones.</p>

<p>From the fourth at noone, to the twentie
fiue, at two of the clocke in the afternoone,
I sayled thirteene leagues West North-west:
and the weather continuing very foggy, thicke,
and rainy, about fiue of the clocke it began
to cease, and then we began to fish, and so continued
vntill seuen of the clocke in betweene
thirty and forty fathoms, and then we could fish
no longer. So hauing gotten betweene twentie
and thirty Cods, we left for that night: and at
fiue of the clocke, the twenty sixe in the morning
we began to fish againe, and so continued
vntill ten of the clocke, and then it would fish
no longer: in which time we had taken neere
one hundred Cods, and a couple of Hollybuts.
All this while wee had betweene thirty and
forty fathoms water: before one of the clocke
in the afternoone we found the ship driuen
into one hundred and twenty fathoms, and soft
blacke Ose. Then Sir George Somers sent me
word, that he would set saile, and stand in for
the Riuer of Sagadahoc; whose directions I
followed.</p>

<p>Before two of the clocke we set saile, and
stirred away North-west by North, the wind
South South-west, and the weather continued
very foggy. About eight of the clocke wee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
tooke in all our sailes, and lay at Hull at that
night. The seuen and twentieth, about seuen
of the clocke in the morning we heaued the
lead, and had no ground in one hundred and
twentie fathoms. Then I shot off a Peece, but
could not heare none answere from our Admirall:
and the weather was so thicke, that we
could not see a Cables length from our ship.
Betweene nine and ten of the clock we did
thinke that we did heare a Peece of Ordnance
to windward: which made me suppose our
Admirall had set saile, and that it was a warning
piece from him. So I set sayle and stood close
by the wind, and kept an hollowing and a noise
to try whether I could find him againe: the
wind was at South-west, and I stood away West
North-west. From the sixe and twentieth, at
two of the clocke in the afternoone, to eight
of the clocke at night I had sayled nine leagues
North-west. The seuen and twentieth at noone
I heaued the Lead, in one hundred and twenty
fathoms, and had no ground. Then I stirred
away North-west, till foure of the clocke at
night: then I heaued the Lead againe one hundred
and twenty fathoms, and had no ground.
Then I tooke all my sailes and lay at Hull, and
I had sayled seuen leagues North-west. The
eight and twentieth, at seuen of the clocke in
the morning I did sound in one hundred and
twenty fathoms, and had no ground. Then I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
set sayle againe, and steered away North, and
North by West. At noone I heaued in one
hundred and twenty fathoms againe, and had
no ground. So I steered on my course still, the
wind shifted betweene South and South-west,
and the fog continued. At foure of the clocke
in the afternoone, I heaued one hundred twenty
fathoms againe, and had no ground: so I stood
on vntill eight of the clocke, by which time
I had sailed twelue leagues: then I heaued the
Lead againe, and had blacke Ose, and one hundred
thirty fiue fathoms water. Then I tooke
in all my sayles and lay at hull vntill the nine
and twentieth, at fiue of the clocke in the morning.
Then I set saile againe, and steered away
North, and North by West. At eight of the
clocke I heaued the Lead againe, and had blacke
Ose in one hundred and thirty fathoms water.
Betweene eleuen and twelue of the clocke it
began to thunder, but the fogge continued not
still. About two of the clocke in the afternoone,
I went out with my Boat my selfe and
heaued the Lead, and had blacke Ose in ninety
fathoms water: by which time I had sailed six
leagues North by West more. Then I tooke
in all my sayles sauing my Fore-course and
Bonnet, and stood in with those sailes onely.
About sixe of the clocke I sounded againe, and
then I had sixty fiue fathoms water. As soone
as I came aboord it cleered vp, and then I saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
a small Iland, which bare North about two
leagues off; whereupon I stood in vntill eight
of the clocke: And then I stood off againe vntill
two of the clocke in the morning the thirtieth
day. Then I stood in againe, and about
eight of the clocke I was faire aboord the Iland.
Then I manned my Boat and went on shoare,
where I found great store of Seales: And I
killed three Seales with my hanger. This Iland
is not halfe a mile about, nothing but a Rocke,
which seemed to be very rich Marble stone.
And a South South-west Moon maketh a full
Sea. About ten of the clocke I came aboord
againe, with some Wood that I had found vpon
the Iland, for there had beene some folkes that
had made fiers there. <span class="sidenote"><i>Seal Rock and Matinicus outside Penobscot Bay</i></span>Then I stood ouer to another
Iland that did beare North off me about
three leagues; this small rockie Iland lyeth in
forty foure degrees. About seuen of the clocke
that night I came to an anchor among many
Ilands in eight fathoms water: and vpon one
of these Ilands I fitted my selfe with Wood and
Water, and Balast.</p>

<p>The third day of August, <span class="sidenote"><i>August</i></span>being fitted to put
to Sea againe, I caused the Master of the ship to
open the boxe wherein my Commission was, to
see what directions I had, and for what place I
was bound to shape my course. Then I tried
whether there were any fish there or not, and
I found reasonable good store there; so I stayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
there fishing till the twelfth of August: and
then finding that the fishing did faile, I thought
good to returne to the Iland where I had killed
the Seales, to see whether I could get any store
of them or not; for I did find that they were
very nourishing meate, and a great reliefe to my
men, and that they would be very well saued
with salt to keepe a long time. But when I
came thither I could not by any meanes catch
any. The fourteenth day at noone I obserued
the Sun, and found the Iland to lie in forty
three degrees, forty minutes. Then I shaped
my course for Cape Cod, to see whether I could
get any fish there or not: so by the fifteenth at
noone, I had sailed thirty two leagues South-west,
the wind for the most part was betweene
North-west and North. From the fifteenth at
noone, to the sixteenth at noone I ran twenty
leagues South, the wind shifting betweene West
and South-west. And then I sounded and had
ground in eighteene fathoms water, full of shels
and peble stones of diuers colours, some greene,
and some blewish, some like diamants, and some
speckled. Then I tooke in all my sayles, and set
all my company to fishing, and fished till eight
of the clocke that night: and finding but little
fish there, I set sayle againe, and by the seuenteenth
at noone I had sayled ten leagues West
by North, the wind shifting betweene South
and South-west. From noone, till sixe of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
clocke at night, foure leagues North-west, the
wind shifting betweene West and South-west.
Then it did blow so hard that I tooke in all my
sayles, and lay at hull all that night, vntill fiue
of the clock the eighteenth day in the morning:
and then I set saile againe, and by noone
I had sailed foure leagues North-west, the wind
betweene West and South-west. From the eighteenth
at noone, to the nineteenth at noone ten
leagues West by West, the wind shifting betweene
South and South-west, and the weather
very thick and foggy.</p>

<p>About seuen of the clocke at night the fogge
began to breake away, and the wind did shift
westerly, and by midnight it was shifted to the
North, and there it did blow very hard vntill
the twenty at noone: but the weather was very
cleere, and then by my obseruation I found the
ship to bee in the latitude of forty one degrees,
forty foure minutes, and I had sailed twenty
leagues South-west by West. From the nineteenth
at noone, to the twentieth at noone:
about two of the clocke in the afternoone I did
see an Hed-land, <span class="sidenote"><i>Cape Cod</i></span>which did beare off me South-west,
about foure leagues: so I steered with it,
taking it to bee Cape Cod; and by foure of the
clocke I was fallen among so many shoales, that
it was fiue of the clocke the next day in the
morning before I could get cleere of them, it
is a very dangerous place to fall withall: for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
shoales lie at the least ten leagues off from the
Land; and I had vpon one of them but one
fathom and an halfe water, and my Barke did
draw seuen foot. This Land lyeth South-west,
and North-east, and the shoales lie off from it
South and South by West, and so along toward
the North. At the North-west by West Guards
I obserued the North-starre, and found the ship
to be in the latitude of fortie one degrees, fiftie
minutes, being then in the middle of the
Sholdes: and I did finde thirteene degrees westerly
variation then likewise. Thus finding the
place not to be for my turne, as soon as I was
cleere of these dangers, I thought it fit to returne
to Iames Towne in Virginia, to the Lord
De-lawarre, my Lord Gouernour, and there to
attend his command: so I shaped my course for
that place.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the moneth of Aprill, 1614, with two
Ships from London, <span class="sidenote"><i>April 1614</i></span>of a few Marchants,
I chanced to arrive in New-England, a
parte of Ameryca, at the Ile of Monahiggan, in
43½ of Northerly latitude: <span class="sidenote"><i>Monhegan</i></span>our plot was there
to take Whales and make tryalls of a Myne of
Gold and Copper. If those failed, Fish and
Furres was then our refuge, to make our selves
savers howsoever: we found this Whalefishing
a costly conclusion: we saw many, and spent
much time in chasing them; but could not kill
any: They beeing a kinde of Iubartes, and not
the Whale that yeeldes Finnes and Oyle as wee
expected. For our Golde, it was rather the
Masters device to get a voyage that proiected it,
then any knowledge hee had at all of any such
matter. Fish and Furres was now our guard:
and by our late arrival, and long lingring about
the Whale, the prime of both those seasons
were past ere wee perceived it; we thinking
that their seasons served at all times: but wee
found it otherwise; for by the midst of Iune,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
the fishing failed. Yet in Iuly and August some
was taken, but not sufficient to defray so great
a charge as our stay required. Of dry fish we
made about 40000. of Cor-fish about 7000.
Whilest the sailers fished, my selfe with eight
or nine others of them might best bee spared;
Ranging the coast in a small boat, wee got
for trifles neer 1100 Bever skinnes, 100 Martins,
and neer as many Otters; and the most of
them within the distance of twenty leagues.
We ranged the Coast both East and West much
furder; but Eastwards our commodities were
not esteemed, they were so neare the French
who affords them better: and right against us
in the Main was a Ship of Sir Frances Popphames,
that had there such acquaintance, having
many yeares used onely that porte, <span class="sidenote"><i>Sagadahock Colony</i></span>that the most
parte there was had by him. And 40 leagues
westwards were two French Ships, that had
made there a great voyage by trade, during the
time wee tryed those conclusions, not knowing
the Coast, nor Salvages habitation. With these
Furres, the Traine, and Cor-fish I returned for
England in the Bark: where within six monthes
after our departure from the Downes, we safe
arrived back. The best of this fish was solde for
five pound the hundreth, the rest by ill usage
betwixt three pound and fifty shillings. The
other Ship staied to fit herselfe for Spaine with
the dry fish which was sould, by the Sailers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
reporte that returned, at forty ryalls the quintall,
each hundred weighing two quintalls and
a halfe.</p>

<p>New England is that part of America in
the Ocean Sea opposite to Nova Albyon <span class="sidenote"><i>California</i></span>in the
South Sea; discovered by the most memorable
Sir Francis Drake in his voyage about the worlde.
In regarde whereto this is stiled New England,
beeing in the same latitude. New France, off
it, is Northward: Southwardes is Virginia, and
all the adioyning Continent, with New Granado,
New Spain, New Andolosia and the West
Indies. Now because I have beene so oft asked
such strange questions, of the goodnesse and
greatnesse of those spatious Tracts of land, how
they can bee thus long unknown, or not possessed
by the Spaniard, and many such like demands;
I intreat your pardons, if I chance to
be too plaine, or tedious in relating my knowledge
for plaine mens satisfaction.</p>

<p>Florida is the next adioyning to the Indies,
which unprosperously was attempted to bee
planted by the French. <span class="sidenote"><i>Ribault Colony 1565</i></span>A Country farre bigger
then England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
yet little knowne to any Christian, but by the
wonderful endevours of Ferdinando de Soto a
valiant Spaniard: whose writings in this age is
the best guide knowne to search those parts.</p>

<p>Virginia is no Ile (as many doe imagine) but
part of the Continent adioyning to Florida;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
whose bounds may be stretched to the magnitude
thereof without offence to any Christian
inhabitant. For from the degrees of 30. to 45.
his Maiestie hath granted his Letters patents,
the Coast extending South-west and North-east
aboute 1500 miles; but to follow it aboard,
the shore may well be 2000. at the least: of
which, 20. miles is the most gives entrance into
the Bay of Chisapeak, where is the London
plantation: within which is a Country (as you
may perceive by the description in a Booke and
Map printed in my name of that little I there
discovered) may well suffice 300000 people to
inhabit. And Southward adioyneth that part
discovered at the charge of Sir Walter Rawley,
by Sir Ralph Lane, and that learned Mathematician
Mr. Thomas Heryot. Northward six or
seaven degrees is the River Sadagahock, where
was planted the Westerne Colony, by that Honourable
Patrone of vertue Sir Iohn Poppham
Lord chief Iustice of England. Ther is also
a relation printed by Captaine Bartholomew
Gosnould, of Elizabeths Iles: and an other by
Captaine Waymoth, of Pemmaquid. From all
these diligent observers, posterity may be bettered
by the fruits of their labours. But for
divers others that long before and since have
ranged those parts, within a kenning sometimes
of the shore, some touching in one place some
in another, I must entreat them pardon me for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
omitting them; or if I offend in saying that their
true descriptions are concealed, or never well
observed, or died with the Authors: so that the
Coast is yet still but even as a Coast unknowne
and undiscovered. I have had six or seaven severall
plots of those Northren parts, so unlike
each to other, and most so differing from any
true proportion, or resemblance of the Countrey,
as they did mee no more good, then so
much waste paper, though they cost me more.
It may be it was not my chance to see the
best; but least others may be deceived as I was,
or throgh dangerous ignorance hazard themselves
as I did, I have drawen a Map from Point
to Point, Ile to Ile, and Harbour to Harbour,
with the Soundings, Sands, Rocks, and Landmarks
as I passed close aboard the Shore in a
little Boat; although there be many things to
bee observed which the haste of other affaires
did cause me omit: for, being sent more to get
present commodities, then knowledge by discoveries
for any future good, I had not power
to search as I would: yet it will serve to direct
any shall goe that waies, to safe Harbours and
the Salvages habitations: What marchandize
and commodities for their labour they may
finde, this following discourse shall plainely
demonstrate.</p>

<p>Thus you may see, of this 2000. miles more
than halfe is yet unknowne to any purpose: no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
not so much as the borders of the Sea are yet
certainly discovered. As for the goodnes and
true substances of the Land, wee are for most
part yet altogether ignorant of them, unlesse
it be those parts about the Bay of Chisapeack
and Sagadahock: but onely here and there wee
touched or have seene a little the edges of those
large dominions, which doe stretch themselves
into the Maine, God doth know how many thousand
miles; whereof we can yet no more iudge,
then a stranger that saileth betwixt England and
France can describe the Harbors and dangers
by landing here or there in some River or Bay,
tell thereby the goodnesse and substances of
Spaine, Italy, Germany, Bohemia, Hungaria and
the rest. By this you may perceive how much
they erre, that think every one which hath been
at Virginia understandeth or knowes what Virginia
is: Or that the Spaniards know one halfe
quarter of those Territories they possesse; no,
not so much as the true circumference of Terra
Incognita, whose large dominions may equalize
the greatnesse and goodnes of America, for any
thing yet known. It is strange with what small
power hee hath raigned in the East Indies; and
few will understand the truth of his strength in
America: where he having so much to keepe
with such a pampered force, they neede not
greatly feare his furie, in the Bermudas, Virginia,
New France, or New England; beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
whose bounds America doth stretch many thousand
miles: into the frozen partes whereof one
Master Hutson an English Mariner did make
the greatest discoverie of any Christian I knowe
of, <span class="sidenote"><i>Hudson’s Bay</i></span>where he unfortunately died. For Affrica,
had not the industrious Portugales ranged her
unknowne parts, who would have sought for
wealth among those fryed Regions of blacke
brutish Negers, where notwithstanding all the
wealth and admirable adventures and endeavours
more than 140 yeares, they knowe not one
third of those blacke habitations. But it is not
a worke for every one, to manage such an affaire
as makes a discoverie, and plants a Colony:
It requires all the best parts of Art, Iudgement,
Courage, Honesty, Constancy, Diligence and
Industrie, to doe but neere well. Some are more
proper for one thing then another; and therein
are to be imployed: and nothing breedes more
confusion than misplacing and mis-imploying
men in their undertakings. Columbus, Cortez,
Pitzara, Soto, Magellanes, and the rest served
more than a prentiship to learne how to begin
their most memorable attempts in the West
Indies; which to the wonder of all ages successfully
they effected, when many hundreds
of others farre above them in the worlds opinion,
beeing instructed but by relation, came to
shame and confusion in actions of small moment,
who doubtlesse in other matters, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
both wise, discreet, generous, and couragious.
I say not this to detract any thing from their
incomparable merits, but to answer those questionlesse
questions that keep us back from imitating
the worthinesse of their brave spirits that
advanced themselves from poore Souldiers to
great Captaines, their posterity to great Lords,
their King to be one of the greatest Potentates
on earth, end the fruites of their labours, his
greatest glory, power and renowne.</p>

<p>That part wee call New England is betwixt
the degrees of 41. and 45: but that parte this
discourse speaketh of, stretcheth but from Pennobscot
to Cape Cod, some 75 leagues by a
right line distant each from other: within which
bounds I have seene at least 40. severall habitations
upon the Sea Coast, and sounded about
25 excellent good Harbours; In many whereof
there is ancorage for 500. sayle of ships of any
burthen; in some of them for 5000: And more
than 200 Iles overgrowne with good timber, of
divers sorts of wood, which doe make so many
harbours as requireth a longer time than I had,
to be well discovered.</p>

<p>The principall habitation Northward we
were at was Penobscot: Southward along the
Coast and up the Rivers we found Mecadacut,
Segocket, Pemmaquid, Nusconcus, Kenebeck,
Sagadahock, and Aumoughcawgen; And to
those Countries belong the people of Segotago,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
Paghhuntanuck, Pocopassum, Taughtanakagnet,
Warbigganus, Nassaque, Masherosqueck,
Wawrigweck, Moshoquen, Wakcogo, Pasharanack,
&amp;c. To these are allied the Countries of
Aucocisco, Accominticus, Passataquack, Aggawom
and Naemkeck: all these, I could perceive,
differ little in language, fashion, or government:
though most be Lords of themselves, yet they
hold the Bashabes of Pennobscot, the chiefe and
greatest amongst them.</p>

<p>The next I can remember by name are Mattahunts;
two pleasant Iles of groves, gardens and
corne fields a league in the Sea from the Mayne.
Then Totant, Massachuset, Pocapawmet, Quonahassit,
Sagoquas, Nahapassumkeck, Topeent,
Seccasaw, Totheet, Nasnocomacak, Accomack,
Chawum; Then Cape Cod by which is Pawmet
and the Ile Nawset of the language, and alliance
of them of Chawum: The others are called
Massachusets; of another language, humor and
condition: For their trade and marchandize;
to each of their habitations they have diverse
Townes and people belonging; and by their
relations and descriptions, more than 20 severall
Habitations and Rivers that stretch themselves
farre up into the Countrey, even to the borders
of diverse great Lakes, where they kill and take
most of their Bevers and Otters. From Pennobscot
to Sagadahock this Coast is all Mountainous
and Iles of huge Rocks, but overgrowen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
with all sorts of excellent good woodes for
building houses, boats, barks or shippes; with
an incredible abundance of most sorts of fish,
much fowle, and sundry sorts of good fruites
for mans use.</p>

<p>Betwixt Sagadahock and Sowocatuck there
is but two or three sandy Bayes, but betwixt
that and Cape Cod very many: especially the
Coast of the Massachusets is so indifferently
mixed with high clayie or sandy cliffes in one
place, and then tracts of large long ledges of
divers sorts, and quarries of stones in other places
so strangely divided with tinctured veines of
divers colours: as, Free stone for building, Slate
for tiling, smooth stone to make Fornaces and
Forges for glasse or iron, and iron ore sufficient,
conveniently to melt in them: but the most
part so resembleth the Coast of Devonshire, I
thinke most of the cliffes would make such
limestone: If they be not of these qualities, they
are so like, they may deceive a better iudgement
then mine; all which are so neere adioyning
to those other advantages I observed in these
parts, that if the Ore prove as good iron and
steele in those parts, as I know it is within the
bounds of the Countrey, I dare engage my head
(having but men skilfull to worke the simples
there growing) to have all things belonging to
the building the rigging of shippes of any proportion,
and good marchandize for the fraught,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span> <span class="sidenote"><i>Freight</i></span>
within a square of 10 or 14 leagues: and were it
for a good rewarde, I would not feare to prooue
it in a lesse limitation.</p>

<p>And surely by reason of those sandy cliffes
and cliffes of rocks, both which we saw so
planted with Gardens and Corne fields, and so
well inhabited with a goodly, strong and well
proportioned people, besides the greatnesse of
the Timber growing on them, the greatnesse
of the fish and moderate temper of the ayre (for
of twentie five, not any was sicke, but two that
were many yeares diseased before they went,
notwithstanding our bad lodging and accidentall
diet) who can but approoue this is a most
excellent place, both for health and fertility?
And of all the foure parts of the world that I
have yet seene not inhabited, could I have but
meanes to transport a Colonie, I would rather
live here than any where: and if it did not
maintaine it selfe, were wee but once indifferently
well fitted, let us starve.</p>

<p>The maine Staple, from hence to bee extracted
for the present to produce the rest, is
fish; which however it may seeme a mean and a
base commoditie: yet who will but truely take
the pains and consider the sequell, I thinke will
allow it well worth the labour. It is strange to
see what great adventures the hopes of setting
forth men of war to rob the industrious innocent,
would procure: or such massie promises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
in grosse: though more are choked then well
fedde with such hastie hopes. But who doth
not know that the poore Hollanders, chiefly
by fishing, at a great charge and labour in all
weathers in the open Sea, are made a people
so hardy, and industrious? and by the venting
this poore commodity to the Easterlings for
as meane, which is Wood, Flax, Pitch, Tarre,
Rosin, Cordage, and such like (which they exchange
againe, to the French, Spaniards, Portugales,
and English, &amp;c. for what they want)
are made so mighty, strong and rich, as no State
but Venice, of twice their magnitude, is so well
furnished with so many faire Cities, goodly
Townes, strong Fortresses, and that aboundance
of shipping and all sorts of marchandize, as well
of Golde, Silver, Pearles, Diamonds, Pretious
Stones, Silkes, Velvets, and Cloth of golde; as
Fish, Pitch, Wood, or such grosse commodities?
What Voyages and Discoveries, East and West,
North and South, yea about the world, make
they? What an Army by Sea and Land, have
they long maintained in despite of one of the
greatest Princes of the world? And never could
the Spaniard with all his Mynes of golde and
Silver, pay his debts, his friends, and army, halfe
so truly, as the Hollanders stil have done by
this contemptible trade of fish. Divers (I know)
may alledge, many other assistances: But this
is their Myne; and the Sea the source of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
silvered streams of all their vertue; which hath
made them now the very miracle of industrie,
the pattern of perfection for these affaires: and
the benefit of fishing is that Primum mobile that
turns all their Spheres to this height of plentie,
strength, honour and admiration.</p>

<p>Herring, Cod, and Ling, is that triplicitie
that makes their wealth and shippings multiplicities,
such as it is, and from which (few would
thinke it) they yearly draw at least one million
and a halfe of pounds starling; yet it is most
certaine (if records be true:) and in this faculty
they are so naturalized, and of their vents so
certainly acquainted, as there is no likelihood
they will ever bee paralleld, having 2 or 3000
Busses, Flat bottomes, Sword pinks, Todes, and
such like, that breedes them Saylers, Mariners,
Souldiers and Marchants, never to be wrought
out of that trade, and fit for any other. I will
not deny but others may gaine as well as they,
that will use it, though not so certainely, nor so
much in quantity; for want of experience. And
this Herring they take upon the Coast of Scotland
and England; their Cod and Ling, upon
the Coast of Izeland and in the North Seas.</p>

<p>Hamborough, and the East Countries, for
Sturgion and Caviare, gets many thousands of
pounds from England, and the Straites: Portugale,
the Biskaines, and the Spaniards, make
40 or 50 Saile yearely to Cape-blank, to hooke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
for Porgos, Mullet, and make Puttardo: and
New found Land, doth yearely fraught neere
800 sayle of Ships with a sillie leane skinny
Poore-Iohn, and Cor-fish, which at least yearely
amounts to 3 or 400000 pound. If from all
those parts such paines is taken for this poore
gaines of fish, and by them hath neither meate,
drinke, nor clothes, wood, iron, nor steele, pitch,
tarre, nets, leades, salt, hookes, nor lines, for
shipping, fishing, nor provision, but at the second,
third, fourth, or fift hand, drawne from so
many severall parts of the world ere they come
together to be used in this voyage: If these I
say can gaine, and the Saylers live going for
shares, lesse then the third part of their labours,
and yet spend as much time in going and comming
as in staying there, so short is the season
of fishing; why should wee more doubt,
then Holland, Portugale, Spaniard, French, or
other, but to doe much better then they, where
there is victuall to feede us, wood of all sorts,
to build Boats, Ships, or Barks; the fish at our
doores, pitch, tarre, masts, yards, and most of
other necessaries onely for making? And here
are no hard Landlords to racke us with high
rents, or extorted fines to consume us, no tedious
pleas in law to consume us with their many
years disputations for Iustice: no multitudes to
occasion such impediments to good orders, as
in popular States. So freely hath God and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
Maiesty bestowed those blessings on them that
will attempt to obtaine them, as here every man
may be master and owner of his owne labour
and land; or the greatest part in a small time.
If hee have nothing but his hands, he may set
up this trade: and by industrie quickly grow
rich; spending but halfe that time wel, which
in England we abuse in idlenes, worse or as ill.
Here is ground also as good as any lyeth in the
height of forty one, forty two, forty three, &amp;c.
which is as temperate and as fruitfule as any
other paralell in the world. As for example, on
this side the line West of it in the South Sea, is
Nova Albion, discovered as is said, by Sir Francis
Drake. East from it, is the most temperate part
of Portugale, the ancient kingdomes of Galazia,
Biskey, Navarre, Arragon, Catalonia, Castilia
the olde and the most moderatest of Castilia
the new, and Valentia, which is the greatest part
of Spain: which if the Spanish Histories bee
true, in the Romanes time abounded no lesse
with golde and silver Mines, then now the West
Indies; The Romanes then using the Spaniards
to work in those Mines, as now the Spaniard
doth the Indians.</p>

<p>In France, the Provinces of Gasconie, Langadock,
Avignon, Province, Dolphine, Pyamont,
and Turyne, are in the same paralel: which are
the best and richest parts of France. In Italy,
the provinces of Genua, Lumbardy, and Verona,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
with a great part of the most famous
State of Venice, the Dukedoms of Bononia,
Mantua, Ferrara, Ravenna, Bolognia, Florence,
Pisa, Sienna, Urbine, Ancona, and the ancient
Citie and Countrey of Rome, with a great part
of the great Kingdome of Naples. In Slavonia,
Istrya, and Dalmatia, with the Kingdomes of
Albania. In Grecia, that famous Kingdome
of Macedonia, Bulgaria, Thessalia, Thracia, or
Romania, where is seated the most pleasant
and plentifull Citie in Europe, Constantinople.
In Asia also, in the same latitude, are the temperatest
parts of Natolia, Armenia, Persia, and
China, besides divers other large Countries and
Kingdomes in these most milde and temperate
Regions of Asia. Southward, in the same
height, is the richest of golde Mynes, Chily and
Baldivia, and the mouth of the great River of
Plate, &amp;c: for all the rest of the world in that
height is yet unknowne. Besides these reasons,
mine owne eyes that have seene a great part of
those Cities and their Kingdomes, as well as it,
can finde no advantage they have in nature, but
this. They are beautified by the long labor and
diligence of industrious people and Art. This
is onely as God made it, when he created the
worlde. Therefore I conclude, if the heart and
intralls of those Regions were sought: if their
Land were cultured, planted and manured by
men of industrie, iudgement, and experience;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
what hope is there, or what neede they doubt,
having those advantages of the Sea, but it might
equalize any of those famous Kingdomes, in all
commodities, pleasures, and conditions? seeing
even the very edges doe naturally afford us such
plenty, as no ship need returne away empty;
and onely use but the season of the Sea, fish
will returne an honest gaine, beside all other
advantages; her treasures having yet never beene
opened, nor her originalls wasted, consumed,
nor abused.</p>

<p>And whereas it is said, the Hollanders serve
the Easterlings themselves, and other parts that
want with Herring, Ling, and wet Cod; the
Easterlings, a great part of Europe, with Sturgion
and Caviare; Cape-blanke, Spain, Portugale,
and the Levant, with Mullet, and Puttargo;
New found Land, all Europe, with a thin Poore
Iohn; yet all is so overlade with fishers, as the
fishing decayeth, and many are constrained to
returne with a small fraught. Norway, and Polonia,
Pitch, Tar, Masts, and Yardes; Sweathland,
and Russia, Iron, and Ropes; France, and
Spaine, Canvas, Wine, Steele, Iron, and Oyle;
Italy and Greece, Silks, and Fruites. I dare
boldly say, because I have seen naturally growing,
or breeding in those parts the same materialls
that all those are made of, they may as
well be had here, or the most part of them,
within the distance of 70 leagues for some few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
ages, as from all those parts; using but the same
meanes to have them that they doe, and with
all those advantages.</p>

<p>First, the ground is so fertill, that questionless
it is capable of producing any Grain, Fruits,
or Seeds you will sow or plant, growing in the
Regions afore named: But it may be, not every
kinde to that perfection of delicacy; or some
tender plants may miscarie, because the Summer
is not so hot, and the winter is more colde
in those parts wee have yet tryed neere the Sea
side, then we finde in the same height in Europe
or Asia; <span class="sidenote"><i>Monhegan</i></span>Yet I made a Garden upon the
top of a Rockie Ile in 43½, 4 leagues from the
Main, in May, that grew so well, as it served
us for sallets in Iune and Iuly. All sorts of
cattell may here be bred and fed in the Iles,
or Peninsulaes, securely for nothing. In the Interim
till they encrease if need be (observing
the seasons) I durst undertake to have corne
enough from the Salvages for 300 men, for a
few trifles; and if they should bee untoward
(as it is most certaine they are) thirty or forty
good men will be sufficient to bring them all
in subiection, and make this provision; if they
understand what they doe: 200 whereof may
nine monethes in the yeare be imployed in
making marchandable fish, till the rest provide
other necessaries, fit to furnish us with other
commodities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>In March, April, May, and halfe Iune, here
is Cod in abundance; in May, Iune, Iuly, and
August Mullet and Sturgion; whose roes doe
make Caviare and Puttargo. Herring, if any
desire them, I have taken many out of the
bellies of Cod, some in nets; but the Salvages
compare their store in the Sea, to the haires
of their heads: and surely there are an incredible
abundance upon this Coast. In the end of
August, September, October, and November,
you have Cod againe to make Cor-fish, or Poore
Iohn: and each hundred is as good as two
or three hundred in the New-found Land. So
that halfe the labour in hooking, splitting, and
turning, is saved: and you may have your fish
at what Market you will, before they can have
any in New-found Land: where their fishing
is chiefly but in Iune and Iuly: whereas it is
heere in March, April, May, September, October,
and November, as is said. So that by
reason of this plantation, the Marchants may
have fraught both out and home: which yeelds
an advantage worth consideration.</p>

<p>Your Cor-fish you may in like manner transport
as you see cause, to serve the Ports in Portugale
(as Lisbon, Avera, Porta port, and divers
others, or what market you please) before your
Ilanders returne: They being tyed to the season
in the open sea; you having a double season,
and fishing before your doors, may every night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
sleep quietly a shore with good cheare and what
fires you will, or when you please with your
wives and familie: they onely, their ships in the
maine Ocean.</p>

<p>The Mullets heere are in that abundance,
you may take them with nets, sometimes by
hundreds, where at Cape blank they hooke
them; yet those but one foot and a halfe in
length; these two, three, or foure, as oft I have
measured: much Salmon some have found up
the Rivers, as they have passed: and heer the
ayre is so temperate, as all these at any time
may well be preserved.</p>

<p>Now, young boyes and girles Salvages, or
any other, be they never such idlers, may turne,
carry, and return fish, without either shame or
any great paine: hee is very idle that is past
twelve yeares of age and cannot doe so much:
and she is very olde, that cannot spin a thred to
make engines to catch them.</p>

<p>For their transportation, the ships that go
there to fish may transport the first: who for
their passage will spare the charge of double
manning their ships, which they must doe in
the New-found Land, to get their fraught; but
one third part of that companie are onely but
proper to serve a stage, carry a barrow, and turne
Poor Iohn: notwithstanding, they must have
meate, drinke, clothes, and pattage, as well as the
rest. Now all I desire, is but this; That those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
that voluntarily will send shipping, should make
here the best choice they can, or accept such
as are presented them, to serve them at that
rate: and their ships returning leave such with
me, with the value of that they should receive
comming home, in such provisions and necessarie
tooles, armes, bedding and apparell, salt,
hookes, nets, lines, and such like as they spare
of the remainings; who till the next returne
may keepe their boates and doe them many
other profitable offices: provided I have men
of ability to teach them their functions, and a
company fit for Souldiers to be Ready upon an
occasion; because of the abuses which have
beene offered the poore Salvages, and the liberty
both French or any that will, hath to deale
with them as they please: whose disorders will
be hard to reforme; and the longer the worse.
Now such order with facilitie might be taken,
with every port Towne or Citie, to observe but
this order, With free power to convert the benefits
of their fraughts to what advantage they
please, and increase their numbers as they see
occasion; who ever as they are able to subsist of
themselves, may beginne the new Townes in
New England in memory of their olde: which
freedome being confined but to the necessity of
the generall good, the event (with Gods helpe)
might produce an honest, a noble, and a profitable
emulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>Salt upon salt may assuredly be made; if not
at the first in ponds, yet till they bee provided
this may be used: then the Ships may transport
Kine, Horse, Goates, course Cloath, and such
commodities as we want; by whose arrivall may
be made that provision of fish to fraught the
Ships that they stay not: and then if the sailers
goe for wages, it matters not. It is hard if this
returne defray not the charge: but care must
be had, they arrive in the Spring, or else provision
be made for them against the Winter.</p>

<p>Of certaine red berries called Alkermes
which is worth ten shillings a pound, but of
these hath been sould for thirty or forty shillings
the pound, may yearely be gathered a good
quantitie.</p>

<p>Of the Musk Rat may bee well raised gaines,
well worth their labour, that will endevor to
make tryall of their goodnesse.</p>

<p>Of Bevers, Otters, Martins, Blacke Foxes, and
Furres of price, may yearely be had 6 or 7000:
and if the trade of the French were prevented,
many more: 25000 this yeare were brought
from those Northren parts into France; of
which trade we may have as good part as the
French, if we take good courses.</p>

<p>Of Mynes of Golde and Silver, Copper, and
probabilities of Lead, Christall and Allum, I
could say much if relations were good assurances.
It is true indeed, I made many trials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
according to those instructions I had, which doe
perswade mee I need not despaire, but there
are metalls in the Countrey: but I am no Alchymist,
nor will promise more then I know:
which is, Who will undertake the rectifying of
an Iron forge, if those that buy meate, drinke,
coals, ore, and all necessaries at a deer rate
gaine; where all these things are to be had for
the taking up, in my opinion cannot lose.</p>

<p>Of woods, seeing there is such plenty of all
sorts, if those that build ships and boates, buy
wood at so great a price, as it is in England,
Spaine, France, Italy, and Holland, and all
other provisions for the nourishing of mans
life; live well by their trade: when labour is
all required to take those necessaries without
any other tax; what hazard will be here, but
doe much better? And what commoditie in
Europe doth more decay then wood? For the
goodnesse of the ground, let us take it fertill,
or barren, or as it is: seeing it is certaine it
beares fruites, to nourish and feed man and
beast, as well as England, and the Sea those
severall sorts of fish I have related. Thus seeing
all good provisions for mans sustenance, may
with this facility be had, by a little extraordinarie
labour, till that transported be increased;
and all necessaries for shipping, onely for labour:
to which may bee added the assistance of
the Salvages, which may easily be had, if they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
be discreetly handled in their kindes, towards
fishing, planting and destroying woods. What
gaines might be raised if this were followed
(when there is but once men to fill your store
houses, dwelling there, you may serve all Europe
better and farre cheaper, then can the Izeland
fishers, or the Hollanders, Cape blank, or New
found Land: who must be at as much more
charge than you) may easily be coniectured by
this example.</p>

<p>2000. pound will fit out a ship of 200. and 1
of a 100 tuns: If the dry fish they both make,
fraught that of 200. and goe for Spaine, sell it
but at ten shillings a quintall; but commonly
it giveth fifteen, or twentie: especially when it
commeth first, which amounts to 3 or 4000
pound: but say but tenne, which is the lowest,
allowing the rest for waste, it amounts at that
rate, to 2000 pound, which is the whole charge
of your two ships, and their equipage: Then
the returne of the money, and the fraught of
the ship for the vintage, or any other voyage, is
cleere gaine, with your shippe of a 100 tuns of
Train and oyle, besides the bevers, and other
commodities; and that you may have at home
within six monethes, if God please but to send
an ordinarie passage. Then saving halfe this
charge by the not staying of your ships, your
victual, overplus of men and wages; with her
fraught thither of things necessarie for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
planters, the salt being there made: as also may
the nets and lines, within a short time: if nothing
were to bee expected but this, it might
in time equalize your Hollanders gaines, if not
exceed them: they returning but wood, pitch,
tarre, and such grosse commodities; you wines,
oyles, fruits, silkes, and such Straits commodities,
as you please to provide by your Factors,
against such times as your shippes arrive with
them. This would so increase our shipping and
sailers, and so employ and encourage a great
part of our idlers and others that want imployments
fitting their qualities at home, where
they shame to doe that they would doe abroad;
that could they but once taste the sweet fruites
of their owne labours, doubtlesse many thousands
would be advised by good discipline, to
take more pleasure in honest Industrie, then in
their humours of dissolute idlenesse.</p>

<p>But, to returne a little more to the particulars
of this Countrey, which I intermingle thus
with my proiects and reasons, not being so sufficiently
yet acquainted in those parts, to write
fully the estate of the Sea, the Ayre, the Land,
the Fruites, the Rocks, the People, the Government,
Religion, Territories, and Limitations,
Friends, and Foes: but, as I gathered from the
niggardly relations in a broken language to my
understanding, during the time I ranged those
countries &amp;c. The most Northren part I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
at, was the Bay of Pennobscot, <span class="sidenote"><i>Penobscot</i></span>which is East
and West, North and South, more then ten
leagues: but such were my occasions, I was
constrained to be satisfied of them I found in
the Bay, that the River ranne farre up into the
Land, and was well inhabited with many people,
but they were from their habitations, either
fishing among the Iles, or hunting the Lakes
and Woods, for Deer and Bevers. The Bay is
full of great Ilands, of one, two, six, eight, or
ten miles in length, which divides it into many
faire and excellent good harbours. On the East
of it, are the Tarrantines, their mortall enemies,
where inhabit the French, as they report
that live with those people, as one nation or
family. And Northwest of Pennobscot is Mecaddacut,
at the foot of a high mountaine, a
kinde of fortresse against the Tarrantines, adioyning
to the high mountaines of Pennobscot,
against whose feet doth beat the Sea: But over
all the Land, Iles, or other impediments, you
may well see them sixteene or eighteene leagues
from their situation. Segocket is the next; then
Nusconcus, Pemmaquid, and Sagadahock. Up
this river where was the westerne plantation
are Aumuckcawgen, Kinnebeck, and divers
others, where there is planted some corne fields.
Along this River 40 or 50 miles, I saw nothing
but great high cliffes of barren Rocks, overgrowne
with wood: but where the Salvages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
dwelt there the ground is exceeding fat and fertill.
Westward of this River, is the Countrey
of Aucocisco, in the bottome of a large deepe
Bay, full of many great Iles, which divides it
into many good harbours. Sowocotuck is the
next, in the edge of a large sandy Bay, which
hath many Rocks and Iles, but few good harbours,
but for Barks, I yet know. But all this
Coast to Pennobscot, and as farre I could see
Eastward of it is nothing but such high craggy
Cliffy Rocks and stony Iles, that I wondered
such great trees could growe upon so hard foundations.
It is a Countrie rather to affright, then
delight one. And how to describe a more
plaine spectacle of desolation or more barren I
knowe not. Yet the Sea there is the strangest
fish-pond I ever saw; and those barren Iles so
furnished with good woods, springs, fruits, fish,
and fowle, that it makes mee thinke though
the Coast be rockie, and thus affrightable; the
Vallies, Plaines, and interior parts, may well
(notwithstanding) be verie fertile. But there
is no kingdom so fertile hath not some part
barren: and New England is great enough, to
make many Kingdomes and Countries, were
it all inhabited. As you passe the Coast still
Westward, Accominticus and Passataquack are
two convenient harbors for small barks; and a
good Countrie, within their craggie cliffs. Angoam
is the next; This place might content a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
right curious iudgement: but there are many
sands at the entrance of the harbor: and the
worst is, it is inbayed too farre from the deepe
Sea. Heere are many rising hilles, and on their
tops and descents many corne fields, and delightfull
groves. On the East, is an Ile of two
or three leagues in length; the one halfe, plaine
morish grasse fit for pasture, with many faire
high groves of mulberrie trees gardens: and
there is also Okes, Pines, and other woods to
make this place an excellent habitation, beeing
a good and safe harbor.</p>

<p>Naimkeck though it be more rockie ground
(for Angoam is sandie) not much inferior;
neither for the harbor, nor any thing I could
perceive, but the multitude of people. From
hence doth stretch into the Sea the faire headland
Tragabigzanda, fronted with three Iles
called the three Turks heads: to the North of
this, doth enter a great Bay, where wee founde
some habitations and corne fields: they report
a great River, and at least thirtie habitations,
doo possesse this Countrie. But because the
French had got their trade, I had no leasure to
discover it. The Iles of Mattahunts are on the
West side of this Bay, where are many Iles, and
questionlesse good harbors: and then the Countrie
of the Massachusets, which is the Paradise
of all those parts: for, heere are many Iles all
planted with corne; groves, mulberries, salvage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
gardens, and good harbors: the Coast is for the
most part, high clayie sandie cliffs. The Sea
Coast as you passe, shewes you all along large
corne fields, and great troupes of well proportioned
people: but the French having remained
heere neere sixe weekes, left nothing for us to
take occasion to examine the inhabitants relations,
viz. if there be neer three thousand people
upon these Iles; and that the River doth
pearce many daies iourneis the intralles of that
Countrey. We found the people in those parts
verie kinde; but in their furie no lesse valiant.
For, upon a quarrell wee had with one of them,
hee onely with three others crossed the harbor
of Quonahassit to certaine rocks whereby wee
must passe; and there let flie their arrowes for
our shot, till we were out of danger.</p>

<p>Then come you to Accomack, an excellent
good harbor, good land; and no want of any
thing, but industrious people. After much kindnesse,
upon a small occasion, wee fought also
with fortie or fiftie of those: though some were
hurt, and some slaine; yet within an houre after
they became friendes. Cape Cod is the next
presents it selfe: which is onely a headland of
high hils of sand, <span class="sidenote"><i>Cape Cod</i></span>overgrowne with shrubbie
pines, hurts, and such trash; but an excellent
harbor for all weathers. This Cape is made by
the maine Sea on the one side, and a great Bay
on the other in forme of a sickle: on it doth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
inhabit the people of Pawmet: and in the
bottome of the Bay, the people of Chawum.
Towards the South and South west of this
Cape, is found a long and dangerous shoale of
sands and rocks. But so farre as I incircled it,
I found thirtie fadom water aboard the shore
and a strong current: which makes mee think
there is a Channell about this shoale; where
is the best and greatest fish to be had, Winter
and Summer, in all that Countrie. But, the
Salvages say there is no Channell, but that the
shoales beginne from the maine at Pawmet, to
the Ile of Nausit; and so extends beyond their
knowledge into the Sea. The next to this is
Capawack, and those abounding Countries of
copper, corne, people, and mineralls; which I
went to discover this last yeare: but because
I miscarried by the way, I will leave them, till
God please I have better acquaintance with
them.</p>

<p>The Massachusets, they report, sometimes
have warres with the Bashabes of Pennobscot;
and are not alwaies friends with them of Chawum
and their alliants: but now they are all
friends, and have each trade with other, so farre
as they have societie, on each others frontiers.
For they make no such voiages as from Pennobscot
to Cape Cod; seldom to Massachewset.
In the North (as I have said) they begunne
to plant corne, whereof the South part hath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
such plentie, as they have what they will from
them of the North; and in the Winter much
more plenty of fish and foule: but both Winter
and Summer hath it in the one part or other all
the yeare; being the meane and most indifferent
temper, betwixt heat and colde, of all the
regions betwixt the Lyne and the Pole: but the
furs Northward are much better, and in much
more plentie, then Southward.</p>

<p>The remarkablest Iles and mountains for
Landmarkes are these; The highest Ile or Sorico,
in the Bay of Pennobscot: but the three
Iles and a rock of Matinnack are much furder in
the Sea; Metinicus is also three plaine Iles and
a rock, betwixt it and Monahigan: Monahigan
is a rounde high Ile; and close by it Monanis,
betwixt which is a small harbor where
we ride. In Damerils Iles is such another: Sagadahock
is knowne by Satquin, and foure or
five Iles in the mouth. Smyths Iles are a heape
together, none neere them, against Accominticus.
The three Turks heads are three Iles
seen far to Sea-ward in regard of the head-land.</p>

<p>The cheefe headlands are onely Cape Tragabigzanda
and Cape Cod.</p>

<p>The cheefe mountaines, them of Pennobscot:
the twinkling mountaine of Aucocisco;
the greate mountaine of Sasanou; and the high
mountaine of Massachusit: each of which you
shall finde in the Mappe; their places, formes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
and altitude. The waters are most pure, proceeding
from the intrals of rockie mountaines;
the hearbes and fruits are of many sorts and
kindes: as alkermes, currans, or a fruit like
currans, mulberries, vines, respices, goosberries,
plummes, walnuts, chesnuts, small nuts, &amp;c.
pumpions, gourds, strawberries, beans, pease,
and mayze: a kinde or two of flax, wherewith
they make nets, lines and ropes both small and
great, verie strong for their quantities.</p>

<p>Oke, is the chiefe wood; of which there is
great difference in regard of the soyle where it
groweth, firre, pyne, walnut, chestnut, birch,
ash, elme, cypresse, ceder, mulberrie, plum-tree,
hazell, saxefrage, and many other sorts.</p>

<p>Eagles, Gripes, diverse sorts of Haukes,
Cranes, Geese, Brants, Cormorants, Ducks,
Sheldrakes, Teale, Meawes, Guls, Turkies,
Dive-doppers, and many other sorts, whose
names I knowe not.</p>

<p>Whales, Grampus, Porkpisces, Turbot, Sturgion,
Cod, Hake, Haddock, Cole, Cusk, or
small Ling, Shark, Mackerrell, Herring, Mullet,
Base, Pinacks, Cunners, Pearch, Eels, Crabs,
Lobsters, Muskles, Wilkes, Oysters, and diverse
others &amp;c.</p>

<p>Moos, a beast bigger than a Stagge; Deere,
red, and Fallow; Bevers, Wolves, Foxes, both
blacke and other; Aroughconds, Wild-cats,
Beares, Otters, Martins, Fitches, Musquassus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
and diverse sorts of vermine, whose names I
know not. All these and divers other good
things do heere, for want of use, still increase,
and decrease with little diminution, whereby
they growe to that abundance. You shall scarce
finde any Baye, shallow shore or Cove of sand,
where you may not take many Clampes, or
Lobsters, or both at your pleasure, and in many
places lode your boat if you please; Nor Iles
where you finde not fruits, birds, crabs, and
muskles, or all of them, for taking, at a lowe
water. And in the harbors we frequented, a
little boye might take of Cunners, and Pinacks,
and such delicate fish, at the ships sterne, more
than sixe or tenne can eate in a daie; but with
a casting net, thousands when wee pleased: and
scarce any place, but Cod, Cuske, Holybut,
Mackerell, Scate, or such like, a man may take
with a hooke or line what he will. And, in
diverse sandy Baies, a man may draw with a net
great store of Mullets, Bases, and diverse other
sorts of such excellent fish, as many as his Net
can drawe on shore: no River where there is
not plentie of Sturgion, or Salmon, or both; all
which are to be had in abundance observing
but their seasons. But if a man will goe at
Christmasse to gather Cherries in Kent, he may
be deceived; though there be plentie in Summer:
so, heere these plenties have each their seasons,
as I have expressed. We for the most part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
had little but bread and vinegar: and though
the most part of Iuly when the fishing decaied
they wrought all day, laie abroade in the Iles
all night, and lived on what they found, yet
were not sicke: But I would wish none put
himself long to such plunges; except necessitie
constraine it: yet worthy is that person to
starve that heere cannot live; if he have sense,
strength and health: for there is no such penury
of these blessings in any place, but that a
hundred men may, in one houre or two, make
their provisions for a day: and hee that hath
experience to manage well these affaires, with
fortie or thirtie honest industrious men, might
well undertake (if they dwell in these parts) to
subiect the Salvages, and feed daily two or three
hundred men, with as good corne, fish and flesh,
as the earth hath of those kindes, and yet make
that labor but their pleasure: provided that they
have engins, that be proper for their purposes.</p>

<p>Who can desire more content, that hath
small meanes; or but only his merit to advance
his fortune, then to tread, and plant that ground
hee hath purchased by the hazard of his life?
If he have but the taste of virtue, and magnanimitie,
what to such a minde can bee more
pleasant, then planting and building a foundation
for his Posteritie, gotte from the rude earth,
by Gods blessing and his owne industrie, without
prejudice to any? If hee have any graine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
of faith or zeale in Religion, what can hee
doe lesse hurtfull to any; or more agreeable
to God, then to seeke to convert those poore
Salvages to know Christ, and humanitie, whose
labors with discretion will triple requite thy
charge and paines? What so truely sutes with
honour and honestie, as the discovering things
unknowne? erecting Townes, peopling Countries,
informing the ignorant, reforming things
unjust, teaching virtue; and gaine to our Native
mother-countrie a kingdom to attend her; finde
imployment for those that are idle, because they
know not what to doe: so farre from wronging
any, as to cause Posteritie to remember
thee; and remembering thee, ever honour that
remembrance with praise?</p>

<p class="p1 noindent fs135"><em>Sir</em>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was the nineteenth of May, <span class="sidenote"><i>1619 May</i></span>before I was
fitted for my discouery, when from <em>Monahiggan</em>
I set sayle in an open Pinnace of fiue
tun, for the Iland I told you of. <span class="sidenote"><i>Monhegan</i></span>I passed alongst
the Coast where I found some antient Plantations,
not long since populous now vtterly void;
in other places a remnant remaines, but not free
of sicknesse. Their disease the Plague, for wee
might perceiue the sores of some that had escaped,
who described the spots of such as vsually
die. When I arriued at my Sauages natiue Country
(finding all dead) I trauelled alongst a daies
iourney Westward, to a place called <em>Nummastaquyt</em>,
where finding Inhabitants, I dispatched
a Messenger a dayes iourney further West, to
<em>Poconaokit</em> which bordereth on the Sea; whence
came to see me two Kings, attended with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
guard of fiftie armed men, who being well satisfied
with that my Sauage and I discoursed
vnto them (being desirous of noueltie) gaue
mee content in whasoeuer I demanded, where
I found that former relations were true. Here I
redeemed a <em>Frenchman</em>, and afterwards another
at <em>Mastachusit</em>, who three yeeres since escaped
shipwracke at the North-east of Cape <em>Cod</em>. I
must (amongst many things worthy obseruation)
for want of leisure, therefore hence I passe
(not mentioning any place where we touched
in the way) to the Iland, which wee discouered
the twelfth of Iune. <span class="sidenote"><i>June</i></span>Here we had good quarter
with the Sauages, who likewise confirmed
former reports. I found seuen seuerall places
digged, sent home of the earth, with samples
of other commodities elsewhere found, sounded
the Coast, and the time being farre spent
bare vp for <em>Monahiggan</em>, arriuing the three and
[twen]tieth of Iune, where wee found our Ship
ready to depart. To this Ile are two other neere
adioyning, all which I called by the name of
King <em>Iames</em> his Iles, because from thence I had
the first motiues to search. For that (now probable
passage) which may hereafter be both honourable
and profitable to his Maiestie. When I
had dispatched with the ships ready to depart,
I thus concluded for the accomplishing my
businesse. In regard of the fewnesse of my men,
not being able to leaue behind mee a competent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
number for defence, and yet sufficiently
furnish my selfe, I put most of my prouisions
aboord the <i>Sampson</i> of Cape <em>Ward</em> ready bound
for <em>Virginia</em>, from whence hee came, taking no
more into the Pinnace then I thought might
serue our turnes, determining with Gods helpe
to search the Coast along, and at <em>Virginia</em> to supply
our selues for a second discouery, if the first
failed. But as the best actions are commonly
hardest in effecting and are seldome without
their crosses, so in this we had our share, and
met with many difficulties: for wee had not
sayled aboue forty leagues, but wee were taken
with a Southerly storme, which draue vs to this
strait; eyther we must weather a rockie point
of Land, or run into a broad Bay no lesse dangerous;
<em>Incidit in Syllam, &amp;c.</em> the Rockes wee
could not weather, though wee loosed till we
receiued much water, but at last were forced
to beare vp for the Bay, and run on ground
a furlong off the shoare, where we had beene
beaten to pieces, had wee not instantly throwne
ouerboord our prouisions to haue our liues; by
which meanes we escaped and brought off our
Pinnace the next high water without hurt, hauing
our Planke broken, and a small leake or
two which we easily mended. Being left in this
misery, hauing lost much bread, all our Beefe
and Sider, some Meale and Apparell, with other
prouisions and necessaries; having now little left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
besides hope to encourage vs to persist: Yet
after a little deliberation we resolued to proceed
and departed with the next faire winde.
We had not now that faire quarter amongst the
Sauages as before, which I take it was by reason
of our Sauages absence, who desired (in regard
of our long iourney) to stay with some of our
Sauage friends at <em>Sawahquatooke</em>, for now almost
euery where, where they were of any strength
they sought to betray vs. At <em>Manamock</em> <span class="sidenote"><i>Monomoy</i></span>(the
Southerne part of Cape <em>Cod</em>, now called <em>Sutcliffe
Inlets</em>) I was vnawares taken prisoner, when they
sought to kill my men, which I left to man the
Pinnace; but missing of their purpose, they
demanded a ransome, which had, I was as farre
from libertie as before; yet it pleased God at
last, after a strange manner to deliuer me, with
three of them into my hands, and a little after
the chiefe <em>Sacheum</em> himselfe; who seeing me
weigh anchor, would haue leaped ouerboord,
but intercepted, craued pardon, and sent for the
Hatchets giuen for ransome, excusing himselfe
by laying the fault on his neighbours; and to
be friends sent for a <em>Canoas</em> lading of Corne,
which receiued we set him free. I am loth to
omit the story, wherein you would finde cause
to admire the great mercy of God euen in our
greatest misery, in giuing vs both freedome and
reliefe at one time. Departing hence, the next
place we arriued at was <em>Capaock</em>, an Iland formerly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
discouered by the <em>English</em>, where I met
with <em>Epinew</em> a Sauage that had liued in <em>England</em>,
and speakes indifferent good <em>English</em>, who foure
yeeres since being carried home, was reported to
haue beene slaine, with diuers of his Countreymen,
by Saylors, which was false. With him I
had much conference, who gaue mee very good
satisfaction in euery thing almost I could demand.
Time not permitting mee to search here,
which I should haue done for sundry things of
speciall moment: the wind faire, I stood away
shaping my course as the Coast led mee, till
I came to the most Westerly part where the
Coast began to fall away Southerly. In my
way I discouered Land about thirtie leagues
in length, <span class="sidenote"><i>Martha’s Vineyard</i></span>heretofore taken for Mayne, where
I feared I had beene imbayed, but by the helpe
of an <em>Indian</em> I got to the Sea againe, through
many crooked and streight passages. I let passe
many accidents in this iourney occasioned by
treacherie, where wee were compelled twice to
goe together by the eares, once the Sauages had
great advantage of vs in a streight, not aboue a
Bowe shot, and where a multitude of <em>Indians</em> let
flye at vs from the banke, but it pleased God to
make vs victours: neere vnto this wee found a
most dangerous Catwract amongst small rockie
Ilands, occasioned by two vnequall tydes, the
one ebbing and flowing two houres before the
other: here wee lost an Anchor by the strength<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
of the current, but found it deepe enough: from
hence were wee carried in a short space by
the tydes swiftnesse into a great Bay (to vs so
appearing) but indeede is broken land, which
gaue vs light of the Sea: here, as I said, the
Land treadeth Southerly. In this place I talked
with many Saluages, who told me of two sundry
passages to the great Sea on the West, <span class="sidenote"><i>Long Island Sound</i></span>offered
me Pilots, and one of them drew mee a Plot
with Chalke vpon a Chest, whereby I found it
a great Iland, parted the two Seas; they report
the one scarce passable for shoalds, perillous
currents, the other no question to be made of.
Hauing receiued these directions, I hastened to
the place of greatest hope, where I purposed to
make triall of Gods goodnesse towards vs, and
vse my best endeuour to bring the truth to light,
but wee were but onely shewed the entrance,
where in seeking to passe wee were forced backe
with contrary and ouerblowing windes, hardly
escaping both our liues. Being thus ouercharged
with weather, I stood alongst the coast to seeke
harbours, to attend a fauourable gale to recouer
the streight, but being a harbourlesse Coast for
ought we could then perceiue, wee found no succour
till wee arriued betwixt Cape <em>Charles</em> and
the Maine on the East side the Bay <em>Chestapeake</em>, <span class="sidenote"><i>Chesapeake Bay</i></span>
where in a wilde Roade wee anchored; and the
next day (the eight of September) crossed the
Bay to <em>Kecoughtan</em>, where the first newes strooke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
cold to our hearts, the general sicknesse ouer the
Land. Here I resolued with all possible speede
to returne in pursuite of this businesse, so that
after a little refreshing, wee recouered vp the
Riuer to <em>Iames</em> Citie, and from thence to Cape
<em>Warde</em> his <em>Plantacon</em>, where immediately wee
fell to hewing of Boords for a close Decke, hauing
found it a most desired course to attempt as
before. As wee were thus labouring to effect
our purposes, it pleased almighty God (who
onely disposeth of the times and seasons, wherein
all workes shall be accomplished) to visite
vs with his heauie hand, so that at one time
there were but two of vs able to helpe the rest,
my selfe so sore shaken with a burning feauer,
that I was brought euen vnto deaths doore, but
at length by Gods assistance escaped, and haue
now with the rest almost recouered my former
strength. The Winter hauing ouertaken vs (a
time on these Coasts especially) subiect to gusts
and fearefull storms, I haue now resolued to
choose a more temperate season, both for the
generall good and our owne safeties. And thus
I haue sent you a broken discourse, though indeede
very vnwilling to haue giuen any notice
at all, till it had pleased God to haue blessed
mee with a thorow search, that our eyes might
haue witnessed the truth. I haue drawne a Plot
of the Coast, which I dare not yet part with
for feare of danger, let this therefore serue for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
confirmation of your hopes, till I can better performe
my promise and your desire; for what I
haue spoken I can produce at least <em>mille testes</em>;
farre separate, of the Sea behinde them, and of
Ships, which come many dayes iourney from
the West, and of the great extent of this Sea to
the North and South, not knowing any bounds
thereof Westward. I cease to trouble you till
a better opportunity offer it selfe, remembring
my best loue, &amp;c. I rest</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Christopher Levett</span>, <em>who was born in York, England,
in 1586, landed on the Isles of Shoals in the autumn
of 1623. Finding that this was no place for a permanent
settlement, he crossed to the mouth of the Piscataqua
River, where Robert Gorges, who had recently been appointed
governor of the territory granted to the Council
for New England, was making his colonial headquarters.
Levett had been given the right to settle and hold
six thousand acres wherever he might choose to locate
within this territory. He selected an island at the mouth
of Portland harbour. There he left ten men to maintain
his possession while he went back to England for recruits
and supplies. To assist in securing these, he wrote an
account of the country and of his adventures therein,
which he doubtless intended to print as soon as he returned
home. A variety of causes hindered the carrying
out of his plans, and the book was not published until
1628. The chapters now reprinted are those which
contain the account of his experiences in New England.
These chapters, as well as the extracts from Purchas
and other works not otherwise credited, are taken from

their names, and which

which not.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE first place I set my foote vpon in
<em>New England</em>, <span class="sidenote"><i>1623</i></span>was the Isles of <em>Shoulds</em>,
being Ilands in the Sea, about two
Leagues from the Mayne.</p>

<p>Vpon these Ilands, I neither could see one
good timber tree, nor so much good ground as
to make a garden.</p>

<p>The place is found to be a good fishing place
for 6 Shippes, but more cannot well be there
for want of convenient stage-roome, as this
yeare’s experience hath proved.</p>

<p>The Harbor is but indifferent good. Vpon
these Ilands are no Savages at all.</p>

<p>The next place I came vnto was <em>Pannaway</em>, <span class="sidenote"><i>Piscataqua River</i></span>
where one <em>M. Tomson</em> hath made a Plantation,
there I stayed about one Moneth in which time
I sent for my men from the East: who came
over in diverse Shipps.</p>

<p>At this place I met with the Governour, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
came thither in a Barke which he had from
one <em>M. Weston</em> about 20 dayes before I arived
in the Land.</p>

<p>The Governour then told me that I was
joyned with him in Commission as a Counsellor,
which being read I found it was so. And
he then, in the presence of three more of the
Counsell, administered unto me an oath.</p>

<p>After the meeting of my men, I went a
coasting in two boats with all my company.</p>

<p>In the time I stayd with <em>M. Tomson</em>, I surveyed
as much as possible I could, the wether
being vnseasonable, and very much snow.</p>

<p>In those parts I saw much good Timber. But
the ground it seemed to me not to be good,
being very rockey and full of trees and brush-wood.</p>

<p>There is great store of fowle of diverse sorts,
wherof I fed very plentifully.</p>

<p>About two English miles further to the East,
I found a great River and a good harbour called
<em>Pascattaway</em>. But for the ground I can say
nothing, but by the relation of the <em>Sagamore</em>
or King of that place, who told me there was
much good ground up in the river about seven
or eight leagues.</p>

<p>About two leagues further to the East, is another
great river called <em>Aquamenticus</em>. <span class="sidenote"><i>York River</i></span>There I
think a good plantation may be settled, for there
is a good harbour for ships, good ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
much already cleared, fit for planting of corne
and other fruits, having heretofore ben planted
by the Salvages who are all dead. There is good
timber, and likely to be good fishing, but as
yet there hath beene no tryall made that I can
heare of.</p>

<p>About 6 leagues further to the East is a
harbour called <em>Cape Porpas</em>, the which is indifferent
good for 6 shippes, and it is generally
thought to be an excellent place for fish, but as
yet there hath been no tryall made, but there
may be a good plantation seated, for there is
good Timber and good ground, but will require
some labour and charge.</p>

<p>About foure leagues further East, there is another
harbour called <em>Sawco</em> (betweene this place
and <em>Cape Porpas</em> I lost one of my men) before
we could recover the harbour a great fog or
mist tooke us that we could not see a hundred
yards from us. I perceiving the fog to come
upon the Sea, called for a Compasse and set the
Cape land, by which wee knew how to steare
our course, which was no sooner done but wee
lost sight of land, and my other boate, and the
winde blew fresh against us, so that we were enforced
to strike saile and betake us to our Oares
which wee used with all the wit and strength
we had, but by no meanes could we recover the
shore that night, being imbayed and compassed
round with breaches, which roared in a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
fearfull manner on every side us; wee took counsell
in this extremity one of another what to doe
to save our lives, at length we resolved that to
put to sea againe in the night was no fit course,
the storme being great, and the winde blowing
right of the shore, and to runne our boate on
the shore amongst the breaches, (which roared
in a most fearefull manner) and cast her away
and indanger ourselves we were loath to do, seeing
no land nor knowing where we were. At
length I caused our Killick (which was all the
Anker we had) to be cast forth, and one continually
to hold his hand upon the roode or cable,
by which we knew whether our ancker held
or no: which being done wee commended our
selues to God by prayer, &amp; put on a resolution
to be as comfortable as we could, and so fell
to our victuals. Thus we spent that night, and
the next morning, with much adoe we got into
Sawco, where I found my other boate.</p>

<p>There I stayed fiue nights, the winde beinge
contrary, and the weather very unseasonable,
hauing much raine and snow, and continuall
foggse.</p>

<p>We built us our Wigwam, or house, in one
houres space, it had no frame, but was without
forme or fashion, onely a few poles set up
together, and couered with our boates sailes
which kept forth but a little winde, and lesse
raigne and snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>Our greatest comfort we had, next unto that
which was spirituall, was this we had foule
enough for killing, wood enough for felling,
and good fresh water enough for drinking.</p>

<p>But our beds was the wet ground, and our
bedding our wet cloaths. Wee had plenty of
Craine, Goose, Duckes and Mallard, with other
fowle, both boyled and rosted, but our spits and
racks were many times in danger of burning
before the meate was ready (being but wooden
ones.)</p>

<p>After I had stayed there three daies, and no
likelyhood of a good winde to carrie vs further,
I tooke with me six of my men, and our Armes,
and walked along the shore, to discouer as much
by land as I could: after I had travelled about
two English miles I met with a riuer which
stayed me that I could goe no further by land
that day, but returned to our place of habitation
where we rested that night (hauing our lodging
amended) for the day being dry I caused all
my company to accompany mee to a marsh
ground, where wee gathered euery man his burthen
of long dry grasse, which being spread in
our Wigwam or House, I praise God I rested
as contentedly as euer I did in all my life. And
then came into my minde an old merry saying,
which I haue heard of a beggar boy, who said
if euer he should attaine to be a King, he would
haue a breast of mutton with a pudding in it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
and lodge euery night vp to the eares in drye
straw; and thus I made myselfe and my company
as merry as I could, with this and some
other conceits, making this vse of all, that it
was much better then wee deserued at Gods
hands, if he should deale with vs according to
our sinnes.</p>

<p>The next morning I caused 4 of my men
to rowe my lesser boate to this riuer, who with
much adoe got in myselfe, and 3 more going
by land: but by reason of the extremitie of the
wether we were enforced to stay there that
night, and were constrained to sleepe vpon the
riuer banke, being the best place wee could
finde, the snowe being very deepe.</p>

<p>The next morning wee were enforced to rise
betime, for the tyde came vp so high that it
washed away our fire, and would haue serued vs
so too if we had not kept watch: So wee went
over the riuer in our boate, where I caused
some to stay with her, myselfe being desirous
to discouer further by land, I tooke with me
foure men and walked along the shore about
sixe English miles further to the East, where I
found another riuer, which staied mee. So we
returned backe to Sawco, where the rest of my
company and my other boate lay. That night
I was exceeding sicke, by reason of the wet
and cold and much toyling of my body: but
thankes be to God I was indifferent well the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
next morning, and the winde being faire we
put to sea, and that day came to <em>Quack</em>.</p>

<p>But before I speak of this place I must say
something of <em>Sawco</em>, <span class="sidenote"><i>Saco</i></span>and the too riuers which
I discouered in that bay, which I thinke neuer
Englishman saw before.</p>

<p><em>Sawco</em> is about one league to the North-east
of a cape land. And about one English mile
from the maine lieth sixe Ilands, which make
an indifferent good harbour. And in the maine
there is a Coue or gutt, which is about a cables
length in bredth, and too cables length
long, there two good Ships may ride, being well
mored a head and starne; and within the Coue
there is a great Marsh, where at a high water
a hundredth sayle of Ships may floate, and be
free from all winds, but at low water must ly
a ground, but being soft oase they can take no
hurte.</p>

<p>In this place there is a world of fowle, much
good timber, and a great quantetie of cleare
ground and good, if it be not a little too sandy.
There hath beene more fish taken within too
leagues of this place this yeare then in any other
in the land.</p>

<p>The riuer next to <em>Sawco</em> eastwards, which I
discovered by land, and after brought my boat
into, is the strangest river that ever my eyes
beheld. It flowes at the least ten foot water upright,
and yet the ebbe runs so strong that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
tyde doth not stem it. At three quarters floud
my men were scarce able with foure Oares to
rowe ahead. And more then that, at full Sea I
dipped my hand in the water, quite without the
mouth of the River, in the very main Ocean,
and it was as fresh as though it had been taken
from the head of a Spring.</p>

<p>This River, as I am told by the <em>Salvages</em>,
commeth from a great mountaine called the
Christall hill, being as they say 100 miles in
the Country, yet is it to be seene at the sea
side, and there is no ship ariues in <em>New England</em>,
either to the West so farre as <em>Cape Cod</em>, or
to the East so farre as <em>Monhiggen</em>, but they see
this Mountaine the first land, if the weather be
cleere.</p>

<p>The next river Eastward which I discovered
by land, is about sixe miles from the other.
About these two riuers I saw much good timber
and sandy ground, there is also much fowle,
fish and other commodities: but these places
are not fit for plantation for the present, because
there is no good comming in, either for
ship, or boate, by reason of a sandy breach
which lyeth alongst the shore, and makes all
one breach.</p>

<p>And now in its place I come to <em>Quack</em>,
which I haue named <em>Yorke</em>. At this place there
fished divers ships of <em>Waymouth</em> this yeare.</p>

<p>It lyeth about two leagues to the East of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
<em>Cape Elizabeth</em>. It is a Bay or Sound <span class="sidenote"><i>Portland Harbour</i></span>betwixt
the Maine and certaine Ilands which lyeth in
the sea about one English mile and halfe.</p>

<p>There are foure Ilands which makes one
good harbour, there is very good fishing, much
fowle and the mayne as good ground as any
can desire. There I found one River wherein
the Savages say there is much <em>Salmon</em> and other
good fish. In this Bay, there hath ben taken
this yeare 4. <em>Sturgions</em>, by fishermen who driue
only for <em>Herrings</em>, so that it is likely there may
be good store taken if there were men fit for
that purpose. This River I made bold to call by
my owne name <em>Levetts</em> river, <span class="sidenote"><i>Fore River</i></span>being the first that
discovered it. How farre this river is Navigable
I cannot tell, I haue ben but 6. miles up it, but
on both sides is goodly ground.</p>

<p>In the same Bay I found another River, <span class="sidenote"><i>Presumpscot River</i></span>up
which I went about three miles, and found a
great fall, of water much bigger than the fall
at <em>London</em> bridge, at low water; further a boate
cannot goe, but above the fall the River runnes
smooth againe.</p>

<p>Iust at this fall of water the <em>Sagamore</em> or
King of that place hath a house, where I was
one day when there were two <em>Sagamors</em> more,
their wiues and children, in all about 50. and we
were but 7. They bid me welcome and gaue
me such victualls as they had, and I gaue them
Tobacco and Aqua vitæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>After I had spent a little time with them I
departed &amp; gaue them a small shot, and they
gaue me another. And the great <em>Sagamore</em> of
the East country, whom the rest doe acknowledge
to be chiefe amongst them, hee gaue unto
me a Bevers skin, which I thankfully received,
and so in great loue we parted. On both sides
this river there is goodly ground.</p>

<p>From this harbour to <em>Sagadahock</em>, which is
about 8. or 9. leagues, is all broken Ilands in the
Sea, which makes many excellent good Harbours,
where a thousand saile of Shipps may ride
in safety; the sound going up within the Ilands
to the Cape of <em>Sagadahock</em>.</p>

<p>In the way betwixt <em>Yorke</em> and <em>Sagadahock</em>
lyeth <em>Cascoe</em>, <span class="sidenote"><i>Casco Bay</i></span>a good harbour, good fishing, good
ground, and much fowle. And I am perswaded
that from <em>Cape Elizabeth</em> to <em>Sagadahock</em>, which
is aboue 30 leagues to follow the Maine, is
all exceeding commodious for Plantations: and
that there may be 20 good Townes well seated,
to take the benefit both of the sea, and fresh
Rivers.</p>

<p>For <em>Sagadahock</em> I need say nothing of it,
there hath been heeretofore enough said by
others, and I feare me too much. But the place
is good, there fished this yeare two ships.</p>

<p>The next place I came to was <em>Capemanwagan</em>, <span class="sidenote"><i>Boothbay</i></span>
a place where nine ships fished this yeare.
But I like it not for a plantation, for I could see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
little good timber &amp; lesse good ground, there I
stayed foure nights, in which time, there came
many Savages with their wiues and children,
and some of good accompt amongst them, as
<em>Menarwormet</em> a Sagamore, <em>Cogawesco</em> the Sagamore
of <em>Casco</em> and <em>Quack</em>, now called <em>Yorke</em>,
<em>Somerset</em>, a Sagamore, one that hath ben found
very faithfull to the English, and hath saved
the liues of many of our Nation, some from
starving, others from killing.</p>

<p>They entended to haue ben gone presently,
but hearing of my being there, they desired to
see me, which I understood by one of the Masters
of the Ships, who likewise told me that
they had some store of Beauer coats and skinnes,
and was going to <em>Pemaquid</em> to truck with one
Mr. <em>Witheridge</em>, a Master of a ship of <em>Bastable</em>,
and desired me to use meanes that they should
not carry them out of the harbour, I wisht them
to bring all their truck to one Mr. <em>Cokes</em> stage,
&amp; I would do the best I could to put it away:
some of them did accordingly, and I then sent for
the <em>Sagamores</em>, who came, and after some complements
they told me I must be their cozen,
and that Captaine <em>Gorges</em> was so, (which you
may imagine I was not a little proud of, to be
adopted cozen to so many great Kings at one
instant, but did willingly accept of it) and so
passing away a little time very pleasantly, they
desired to be gone, whereupon I told them that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
I understood they had some coates and Beauers
skins which I desired to truck for but they were
unwilling, and I seemed carelesse of it (as men
must doe if they desire any thing of them.) But
at last <em>Somerset</em> swore that there should be none
carryed out of the harbour, but his cozen <em>Levett</em>
should haue all, and then they began to offer
me some by way of gift, but I would take none
but one paire of sleeues from <em>Cogawesco</em>, but
told them it was not the fashion of English
Captaines alwaies to be taking, but sometimes
to take and giue, and continually to truck was
very good. But in fine, we had all except one
coate and two skinnes, which they reserved to
pay an old debt with, but they staying all that
night, had them stole from them.</p>

<p>In the morning the <em>Sagamores</em> came to mee
with a grieuous complaint, I vsed the best language
I could to giue them content, and went
with them to some Stages which they most
suspected, and seached both Cabins and Chests,
but found none. They seeing my willingnesse
to finde the theefe out, gaue mee thankes, and
wished me to forbeare saying the Rogues had
carried them into the woods where I could not
find them.</p>

<p>When they were ready to depart they asked
mee where I meant to settle my plantation.
I told them I had seene many places to the
west, and intended to goe farther to the east<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
before I could resolue, they sayed there was no
good place, and I had heard, that <em>Pemoquid</em> and
<em>Capmanwagan</em>, and <em>Monhiggon</em> were granted to
others, &amp; the best time for fishing was then
at hand, which made me the more willing to
retire, and the rather because <em>Cogawesco</em>, the
<em>Sagamore</em> of <em>Casco</em> and <em>Quacke</em>, told me if that I
would sit downe at either of those two places,
I should be very welcome, and that he and his
wife would goe along with me in my boate to
see them, which curtesy I had no reason to refuse,
because, I had set vp my resolution before
to settle my plantation at <em>Quacke</em>, which I named
<em>Yorke</em>, and was glad of this oppertunity, that
I had obtained the consent of them who as I
conceiue hath a naturall right of inheritance, as
they are the sonnes of Noah, and therefore doe
thinke it fit to carry things very fairely without
compulsion, (if it be posible) for avoyding
of treacherie.</p>

<p>The next day the winde came faire, and
I sayled to <em>Quacke</em> or <em>Yorke</em>, with the King,
Queene, and Prince, bowe and arrowes, dogge
and kettell in my boate, his noble attendance
rowing by vs in their Cannow.</p>

<p>When we came to <em>Yorke</em> the Masters of the
Shippes came to bid me welcome, and asked
what Sauages those were, I told them, and I
thanked them, they vsed them kindly, &amp; gaue
them meate, drinke and tobacco. The woman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
or reputed Queene, asked me if those men were
my friends, I told her they were; then she dranke
to them, and told them, they were welcome to
her Countrey, and so should all my friends be
at any time, she dranke also to her husband,
and bid him welcome to her Countrey too, for
you must vnderstand that her father was the
<em>Sagamore</em> of this place, and left it to her at his
death hauing no more Children.</p>

<p>And thus after many dangers, much labour
and great charge, I haue obtained a place of
habitation in <em>New-England</em>, where I haue built
a house, and fortified it in a reasonable good
fashion, strong enough against such enemies
as are those Sauage people.</p>


<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i274" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i274.jpg" alt="(Decorative separator)" />
</div>

<p class="negin1 fs120">How the Sauages carried themselues
vnto me continually, and of my
going to their Kings Houses: and
their comming to mine.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILEST I staied in this place I had
some little trucke, but not much,
by reason of an euill member in the
Harbour, who being couetous of trucke vsed
the matter so, that he got the Sauages away
from me.</p>

<p>And it is no wonder that he should abuse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
me in this sort, for he hath not spared your
Lordshipps and all the Counsell for <em>New-England</em>.</p>

<p>He said vnto the Gouernour that the Lords
had sent men ouer into that Countrey with Commissions,
to make a prey of others. And yet for
my owne part I neuer demanded or tooke from
any man in that Countrey, the value of a denier
neither had I so much helpe, from any Shippe
or Shippes companie as one mans labour the
space of an houre, nor, had I any prouision
or victuall vpon any tearmes whatsoeuer, saue
onely 1000. of bread, and 22. bushells of pease,
which was offered vnto mee and not by me requested,
for which I gaue present satisfaction
in <em>Beuer</em> skines: and also one Rownlet of <em>Aqua
vitæ</em>, which was brought to me 16 Leagues vnexpected,
which good manners bid me buy.
Much more provision was offered to me by many
Masters of Ships, but I had no need thereof,
so I gaue them thanks for their kindnesse, and
refused all.</p>

<p>Nay, it is well knowne, that I was so farre
from doing wrong to any: that I suffered the
Land which was granted to me by Pattent and
made choyce of before any other man came
there, to be used, and my timber to be cut
downe &amp; spoyled, without taking or asking
any satisfaction for the same. And I doubt not
but all others to whom you gaue authoritie,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
will sufficiently cleare themselues of all such
imputations.</p>

<p>He said also he cared not for any authoritie in
that place and though he was forbid to trucke
yet would he haue all he could get: in despite of
who should say to the contrary, having a great
Ship with 17. peeces of Ordinance and 50. men.</p>

<p>And indeed his practise was according to his
words, for every Sunday or once in the weeke,
he went himselfe or sent a boate up the river
and got all the trucke before they could come
downe to the Harbour. And so many Savages
as he could get to his stage, hee would enforce
them to leaue their goods behind them. One
instance a mongst many I will giue you.</p>

<p>On a certaine day there came two Savages to
his place, who were under the command of <em>Somerset</em>
or <em>Conway</em>, I know not whether, at which
time they were both with me at my house, but
the other two who went to him, knew not so
much, but afterwards they understanding of it,
came presently over, but left their Cotts and
<em>Beauer</em> skins behind them, whereat <em>Somerset</em> and
<em>Conway</em> were exceeding angrie and were ready
to beate the poore fellows, but I would not
suffer them so to doe. They presently went over
the Harbor themselues in their <em>Cannow</em> to fetch
their goods, but this man would let them haue
none, but wished them to truck with him, they
told him they would not, but would carry them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
to Captaine <em>Levett</em>, he said <em>Levett</em> was no captaine,
but a <em>Iacknape</em>, a poore fellow, &amp;c. They
told him againe that he was a <em>Roague</em>, with
some other speeches, whereupon he and his
company fell upon them &amp; beate them both, in
so much that they came to me in a great rage
against him, and said they would be revenged
on his Fishermen at sea, and much adoe I had
to diswade one of them for going into <em>England</em>
to tell King <em>James</em> of it, as he said; when they
came to me in this rage, there was two or three
Masters of Shippes by, and heard every word.</p>

<p>But all this did me no hurt, (saue the losse
of the trucke, which by divers was thought to
be worth above 50. li.) for the two <em>Sagamores</em>
whom he inticed from me, and incensed against
me, at length used meanes to be freinds with
me, sending one who asked me, if I were angrie
with them, I told them no, I was not angrie
with them for any such matter as lowsie Cotts
and skinnes, but if they were <em>Matchett</em>, that
is, naughtie men, and rebellious, then I would
be <em>Mouchick Hoggery</em>, that is very angry, and
would <em>Cram</em>, that is, kill them all.</p>

<p>When they came them selues to me to seeke
peace, they brought me a <em>Beauer</em> Coate, and two
<em>Otter</em> skines, which they would have let me had
for nothing, but I would not take them so, but
gaue them more then vsually I did by way of
Trucke, I then told them likewise that if at any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
time they did Trucke with mee, they should
haue many good things in leiu of their Beauer:
and if they did not Trucke it was no matter,
I would be good friends with them, at which
they smiled and talked one to the other, saying
the other man was a Iacknape, and that I
had the right fashion of the <em>Aberieney Sagamores</em>,
then they began to applaude or rather flatter
me, saying I was so bigge a <em>Sagamore</em>, yea foure
fathom, which were the best words they could
vse to expresse their minds: I replied that I was
a poore man as he had reported of mee. They
said againe it was no matter what I said, or that
Iacknape (which is the most disgracefull word
that may be in their conceite,) for all the <em>Sagamores</em>
in the Country loued poore <em>Levett</em> and
was Muchicke sorrie that he would be gon, and
indeed I cannot tell what I should thinke of
them, for euer after they would bring mee any
thing they thought would giue mee content, as
Egges and the whole bodyes of <em>Beauer</em>, which
in my concite eate like <em>Lambe</em>, and is not inferiour
to it: yea the very coats of Beauer &amp; <em>Otter-skinnes</em>
from off their backes, which though I
many time refused, yet not allwaies, but I neuer
tooke any such courtesie from them, but I requited
them answerably, chusing rather to neglect
the present profit, then the hopes I haue
to bring them to better things, which I hope
will be for a publicke good, and which I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
perswaded were a greeuous sinne, to neglect for
any sinister end.</p>

<p>And a little before my departure there came
these <em>Sagamores</em> to see mee, <em>Sadamoyt</em>, the great
<em>Sagamore</em> of the East Countrey, <em>Manawormet</em>,
<em>Opparunwit</em>, <em>Skedraguscett</em>, <em>Cogawesco</em>, <em>Somersett</em>,
<em>Conway</em> and others.</p>

<p>They asked me why I would be gone out of
their Countrey, I was glad to tell them my wife
would not come thither except I did fetch her,
they bid a pox on her hounds, (a phrase they
have learned and doe vse when they doe curse)
and wished me to beate her. I told them no,
for then our God would bee angrie. Then they
runne out vpon her in euil tearmes, and wished
me to let her alone and take another, I told
them our God would be more angrie for that.
Againe they bid me beate her, beate her, repeating
it often, and very angerly, but I answered
no, that was not the English fashion, and besides,
she was a good wife and I had children by her,
and I loued her well, so I satisfied them. Then
they told me that I and my wife and Children,
with all my friends, should bee hartily welcome
into that Countrey at any time, yea a hundreth
thousand times, yea <em>Mouchicke</em>, <em>Mouchicke</em>, which
is a word of waight.</p>

<p>And <em>Somersett</em> tould that his Sonne (who was
borne, whilst I was in the Countrey, and whom
hee would needs haue to Name) and mine should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
be Brothers and that there should be muchicke
legamatch, (that is friendship) betwixt them,
untill <em>Tanto</em> carried them to his wigwam, (that
is vntill that they died.)</p>

<p>Then they must know of mee how long I
would be wanting, I told them so many Months,
at which they seemed to be well pleased, but
wisht me to take heede I proued not <em>Chechaske</em>
in that (that is, a lier.) They asked me what I
would doe with my house, I told them I would
leaue 10. of my men there vntill I came againe,
and that they should kill all the <em>Tarrantens</em>
they should see (being enimies to them) and
with whom the English haue no commarsse.
At which they reioyced exceedingly, and then
agreed amongst themselues that when the time
should be expired, which I spoke of for my
returne, euery one at the place where he liued
would looke to the Sea, and when they did see
a Ship they wold send to all the <em>Sagamores</em> in
the Countrey, and tell them that poore <em>Levett</em>
was come againe. And thus insteed of doing
me hurt, I thinke that either he or I haue done
good to all Planters, by winning their affections,
(which may bee made vse of without trusting
of them.)</p>

<p>But if your Lordship should put up this
wrong done unto you, and the Authority which
you gaue them, never expect to be obeyed in
those parts, either by Planters or Fishermen;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
for some haue not stucke to say, that if such a
man, contemning authority, and abusing one of
the counsell, and drawing his knife upon him
at his own house, which he did, should goe unpunished,
then would not they care what they
did heereafter.</p>

<p>And truely let me tell your Lordships, that if
euer you intend to punish any for disobedience,
or contempt of authority, this man is a fit instrument
to make a president of, for he is rich, and
this yeare will gaine the best part of 500 pounds
by that Countrie, and he hath nether wife nor
childe, for whose sakes he should be spared.</p>

<p>And if he goe free, as hee has domineered
over vs, to whom your Lordships gaue authority,
but no power to put it in execution, so will
he grow unmannerly too with your Lordships,
as hee hath already begunne.</p>

<p>And it will discourage men hereafter to take
any authority upon them, or to goe about to
reforme any abuses in those parts, and also it
will hinder Planters for going over, if Fishermen
be suffered not onely to take away their
truck, but also to animate the Sauages against
them, for this is the way to cause all Planters
to haue their throats cut.</p>

<p>But I leaue these things to your Lo. consideration,
who haue as well power as authority
to punish such rebellious persons.</p>

<p>Thus hauing acquainted you with what I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
haue done, seen and heard; now giue me leaue
to tell you what I thinke of the Savages, the
inhabitants of that country: as also to iustifie
the innocent, I meane the Countrie of <em>New-England</em>,
against the slanderous reports of this
man, and some others which I haue heard, and
likewise to deliver my opinion, what courses I
conceiue to be most convenient to be taken,
for bringing most glorie to God, comfort, honor

<p class="negin1 fs120">The nature and disposition of the
Savages, and of their severall Gods,
Squanto and Tanto.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I HAUE had much conference with the
Savages, about our only true God, and haue
done my best to bring them to know and
acknowledge him, but I feare me all the labour
that way, will be lost, and no good will be done,
except it be among the younger sort.</p>

<p>I find they haue two Gods, on they love: and
the other they hate: the god they loue, they call
<em>Squanto</em>, and to him they ascribe all their good
fortunes.</p>

<p>The god they hate they call <em>Tanto</em>, and to
him they ascribe all their euill fortunes, as thus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
when any is killed, hurt or sicke, or when it is
evill wether, then they say <em>Tanto</em> is <em>hoggry</em>, that
is angry. When any dyes, they say <em>Tanto</em> carries
them to his <em>wigwam</em>, that is his house, and they
never see them more.</p>

<p>I haue asked them where <em>Squanto</em> dwells, they
say they cannot tell but up on high, and will
poynt upwards. And for <em>Tanto</em>, they say farre
west, but they know not where.</p>

<p>I haue asked them if at any time they haue
seene <em>Squanto</em>, or <em>Tanto</em>, they say no, there is
none sees them, but their <em>Pawwawes</em>, nor they
neither, but when they dreame.</p>

<p>Their <em>Pawwawes</em> are their Phisitians and
Surgions, and as I verely beleeue they are all
Witches, for they foretell of ill wether, and
many strange things, every <em>Sagamore</em> hath one
of them belongs to his company, and they are
altogether directed by them.</p>

<p>On a time I was at a <em>Sagamores</em> house and saw
a <em>Martins</em> skin, and asked if he would trucke it,
the <em>Sagamore</em> told me no, the <em>Pawwawe</em> used to
lay that under his head when he dreamed, and
if he wanted that, he could doe nothing, thus
we may perceiue how the devill deludes those
poore people and keep them in blindnesse.</p>

<p>I find them generally to be marvellous quicke
of apprehension, and full of subteltie, they will
quickely find any man’s disposition, and flatter
&amp; humour him strangely, if they hope to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
anything of him. And yet will they count him
a foole if he doe not shew a dislike of it, and
will say on to another, that such a man is a
<em>Mechecome</em>.</p>

<p>They are slow of speech, and if they heare a
man speake much they will laugh at him, and
say he is a <em>Mechecum</em>, that is a foole.</p>

<p>If men of place be to familiar with them,
they will not respect them: therefore it is to
be wished that all such persons should be wise
in their Carriage.</p>

<p>The <em>Sagamores</em> will scarce speake to an ordinary
man, but will point to their men, and say
<em>Sanops</em>, must speake to <em>Sanops</em>, and <em>Sagamors</em> to
<em>Sagamors</em>.</p>

<p>They are very bloudy minded and full of
Tracherie amongst themselues, one will kill
another for their wiues, and he that hath the
most wiues is the brauest fellow: therefore I
would wish no man to trust them, what euer
they say or doe; but alwaies to keepe a strickt
hand ouer them, and yet to vse them kindly,
and deale vprightly with them; so shall they
please God, keepe their reputation amongst
them, and be free from danger.</p>

<p>Their <em>Sagamors</em> are no Kings, as I verilie
beleeue, for I can see no Government or Law
amongst them but Club Law: and they call
all Masters of Shippes <em>Sagamore</em>, or any other
man, that they see have a commaund of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p>Their wiues are their slaves, and doe all their
worke the men will doe nothing but kill Beasts,
Fish, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On a time reasoning with one of their <em>Sagamors</em>
about their hauing so many wiues, I tould
him it was no good fashion, he then asked mee
how many wiues King <em>James</em> had, I told him he
neuer had but one, and shee was dead, at which
he wondred, and asked mee who then did all
the Kings worke. You may Imagin he thought
their fashion was vniuersal and that no King had
any to worke for them but their wiufs.</p>

<p>They haue no apparrell but skinnes, except
they haue it from the <em>English</em>, or <em>French</em>, in winter
they weare the haire side inwards, in summer
outwards. They haue a peece of a skinne
about their loines like a girdle and between their
legges goes another, made fast to the girdles
before and behind, which serues to couer their
nakednesse, they are all thus apparrelled, going
bare headed with long haire, sometimes you
shall not know the men from women but by
their breasts, the men having no haire on their
faces.</p>

<p>When their Children are borne they bind
them on a peece of board, and sets it vpright,
either against a tree or any other place. They
keep them thus bound vntill they be three
months old, and after they are continuall naked
vntill they be about fiue or sixe yeares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>Yee shall haue them many times take their
Children &amp; bury them in the snow all but
their faces for a time, to make them the better
to endure cold, and when they are not aboue 2.
yeares old, they will take them and cast them
into the Sea, like a little dogge or Cat, to learne
them to swimme.</p>

<p>Their weapons are bowes and arrowes, I
never saw more then two fowling peeces, one
pistall, about foure Halfe-pikes, and three Curtlaces <span class="sidenote"><i>Cutlasses</i></span>
amongst them, so that we neede not to
feare them much, if wee auoid their Treacherie.</p>

<p>Their houses are built in halfe an houres space
being onely a few powles or boughes stucke in
the ground and couered with the barkes of
trees.</p>

<p>Their Language differs as <em>English &amp; Welch</em>.
On a time the Gouernour was at my house, and
brought with him a <em>Salvage</em>, who liued not
aboue 70. miles from the place which I haue
made choise of, who talking with another Sauage,
they were glad to vse broken <em>English</em> to expresse
their mind each to other, not being able
to vnderstand one another in their Language.</p>

<p>And to say something of the Countrey: I
will not doe therein as some haue done, to my
knowledge speak more then is true: I will not
tell you that you may smell the corne fields before
you see the Land, neither must men thinke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
that corne doth growe naturally (or on trees,)
nor will the <em>Deare</em> come when they are called,
or stand still and looke one a man, untill he
shute him, not knowing a man from a beast,
nor the fish leape into the kettle, nor on the drie
Land, neither are they so plentifull, that you
may dipp them up in baskets, nor take <em>Codd</em> in
netts to make a voyage, which is no truer: then
that the fowles will present themselues, to you
with spitts through them.</p>

<p>But certainely there is fowle, <em>Deare</em>, and Fish
enough for the taking if men be diligent, there
be also Vines, Plume trees, Cherry trees, Strawberies,
Gooseberies, and Raspes, Walnutts, chesnut,
and small nuts, of each great plenty; there
is also great store of parsley, and divers other
holesome Earbes, both for profit and pleasure,
with great store of Saxifrage, Cersa-perilla, and
Anni-seeds.</p>

<p>And for the ground there is large &amp; goodly
Marsh to make meddow, higher land for pasture
and corne.</p>

<p>There be these severall sorts of earth, which
I haue seene, as, <em>Clay</em>, <em>Sand</em>, <em>Grauill</em>, yea and as
blacke fatt earth, as ever I sawe in <em>England</em> in
all my life.</p>

<p>There are likewise these helpes for ground,
as Seasand, <em>Oreworth</em> or <em>Wracke</em>, <em>Marle</em> blew and
white, and some men say there is <em>Lime</em>, but I
must confesse I neuer saw any <em>Lime-stone</em>: but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
I haue tried the Shels of Fish, and I find them
to be good <em>Lime</em>.</p>

<p>Now let any husbandman tell mee, whither
there be any feare of hauing any kind of Corne,
hauing these seuerall kinds of Earth with these
helpes, the Climat being full as good if not better
than <em>England</em>.</p>

<p>I dare be bold to say also, there may be
Shippes as conueniently built there as in any
place of the world, where, I haue beene, and
better cheape. As for Plancke, crooked Timber,
and all other sorts what so euer can be desired
for such purpose, the world cannot afford
better. Masts and Yeards of all sises, there be
allso Trees growing, whereof Pitch and Tarre
is made.</p>

<p>And for Sailes and all sorts of Cordish you
neede not to want, if you will but sowe Hempe
and Flaxseede, and after worke it. Now there
wants nothing but Iron, and truely I thinke
I haue seene Iron-stones there, but I must
acknowledge I haue no great iudgement in
Mineralls, yet I haue seene the Iron-workes
in <em>England</em>, and this Stone is like ours. But
howsoever if the Countrie will not afford Iron,
yet it may be easilie brought, for it is good
Ballast for Shippes.</p>

<p>There is also much excellent Timber for
Ioyners and Coopers: howsoeuer a worthy Noble
man hath beene abused, who sent ouer some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
to make Pippe-staues, who either for want of
skill or industrie, did no good. Yet I dare say no
place in <em>England</em> can afford better Timber for
Pippe-staues, then foure seuerall places which
I haue seene in that Countrey.</p>

<p>Thus haue I relaited vnto you what I haue
seene, and doe know may be had in those parts
of <em>New-England</em> where I haue beene, yet was I
neuer at the Mesachusett, which is counted the
Paradise of <em>New-England</em>, nor at <em>Cape Ann</em>. But
I feare there hath been too faire a glosse set on
<em>Cape Ann</em>. I am told there is a good Harbour
which makes a faire Inuitation, but when they
are in, their entertainement is not answerable,
for there is little good ground, and the Shippes
which fished there this yeare, their boats went
twenty miles to take their Fish, and yet they
were in great feare of making their Voyages, as
one of the Masters confessed vnto me who was
at my house.</p>

<p>Neither was I at <em>New-Plimoth</em>, but I feare
that place is not so good as many other, for if
it were in my conceite they would content
themselues with it and not seeke for any other
hauing ten times so much ground as would
serue ten times so many people as they haue
now amongst them. But it seemes they haue
no Fish to make benifit of, for this yeare they
had one Shippe Fisht at <em>Pemoquid</em>, and an other
at <em>Cape Ann</em>, where they haue begun a new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
Plantation, but how long it will continew I
know not.</p>

<p>Neither was I ever farther to the West then
the Iles of <em>Shoulds</em>.</p>

<p>Thus have I done with my commendations
of the Countrie. I will now speake the worst
I know by it.</p>

<p>About the middle of May you shall haue
little Flies, called <em>Musketoes</em>, which are like
Gnatts, they continue as I am told, vntill the
last of July. These are very troublesome for the
time, for they sting exceedingly both night and
day. But I found by experience that bootes or
thicke stockings would saue the legges, gloues
the hands, and tiffeney or some such things
which will not much hinder the sight will saue
the face, and at night any smoake will secure
a man.</p>

<p>The reason of the aboundance of these creatures,
I take to be the woods which hinders the
aire, for I haue obserued allwaies when the
winde did blow but a little, we were not much
troubled with them.</p>

<p>And I verily thinke that if there were a good
number of people planted together, and that the
woods were cut downe, the earth were tilled,
and the rubbish which lieth on the ground
wherein they breed were burnt, and that there
were many chimneyes smoaking, such small
creatures would doe but little hurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>Another euill or inconuenience I see there,
the snow in winter did lie very long vpon the
ground.</p>

<p>But I understand that all the parts of Christendome,
were troubled with a cold winter
so well as wee. Yet would I aske any man
what hurt snow doeth? The husbandman will
say that Corne is the better for it. And I hope
Cattell may bee as well fed in the house there
as in <em>England</em>, <em>Scotland</em>, and other Countries, and
he is but an ill husband that cannot find imployments
for his seruants within doores for
that time. As for Wiues and Children if they
bee wise they will keepe themselues close by a
good fire, and for men they will haue no occasion
to ride to Faires or Markets, <em>Sysses</em> or Sessions,
only Hawkes and Hounds will not then
be vsefull.</p>

<p>Yet let me tell you that it is still almost
Christmas before there be any winter there, so
that the cold time doth not continue long.</p>

<p>And by all reason that Countrey should be
hotter then England, being many Degrees farther
from the North Pole.</p>

<p>And thus according to my poore understanding
I haue given you the best information I can
of the people and Country, commodities and
discommodities. Now giue mee leaue to oppose
myselfe against the man beforementioned,
and others, who speaks against the Country, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
plantations in those parts, and to set down such
obiections as I haue heard them make, and my
answers, and afterward let wisedome iudge: for
my desire is, that the saddle may be set on the
right horse, and the Asse may be rid, and the
knaue punished, either for discouraging or incouraging
too much, whosoeuer he be.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
